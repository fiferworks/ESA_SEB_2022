  abstract = {Huanglongbing is a highly destructive citrus disease associated with “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” (Las), a phloem−limited and non-culturable bacterium, naturally transmitted by the psyllid Diaphorina citri. Although diverse approaches have been used to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogen–host interaction, such approaches have focused on already infected and/or symptomatic plants, missing early events in the initial days post-inoculation. This study aimed to identify the time course of Las multiplication and whole-plant colonization immediately following inoculation by infected psyllids feeding for 2 days. Thus, the experimental approach was to track Las titers after psyllid inoculation in new shoots (NS) of Citrus × sinensis (susceptible), Murraya paniculata (partially resistant), and Bergera koenigii (fully resistant). Soon after psyllid removal, Las titers dropped until the 10–12th days in all three species. Following this, Las titers increased exponentially only in C. × sinensis and M. paniculata, indicating active bacterial multiplication. In C. × sinensis, Las reached a stationary phase at ∼5 log Las cells/g of tissue from the 40th day onward, while in M. paniculata, Las increased at a lower rate of up to ∼3 log Las cells/g of tissue between the 40th and 60th days, decreasing gradually thereafter and becoming undetectable from the 160th day onward. In B. koenigii, Las titers decreased from the start and remained undetectable. In C. × sinensis, an average of 2.6 log of Las cells/g of tissue was necessary for Las to move out of 50\% of the NS in 23.6 days and to colonize the rest of the plant, causing a successful infection. Conversely, the probability of Las moving out of the NS remained below 50\% in M. paniculata and zero in B. koenigii. To our knowledge, this is the first study on Las dynamics and whole-plant colonization during the earliest stages of infection. Identification of critical time-points for either successful multiplication or Las resistance may help to elucidate initial events of Las–host interactions that may be missed due to longer sampling intervals and at later stages of infection.},

  abstract = {In 2015 the European Union banned importing fresh curry leaves from Sri Lanka due to Citrus greening disease reported in Sri Lanka. Citrus greening is the most dangerous disease in citrus cultivation. The disease is caused by the infection of non-culturable bacteria named Candidatus Liberibacter (CLas). This bacterium transferred by a vector named Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri). Asian citrus psyllid is one of the major pests in Curry leaves. This study was conducted to confirm the existence of Candidatus Liberibacter in Curry leaves by conducting a pathogenicity test to test the ability of CLas to cause the disease. 11 Citrus plants and 11 Curry leaves plants were tested for Candidatus Liberibacter. The presence of CLas in leaf samples were identified by amplification of 1160 bp fragment of 16s rRNA. 10 Curry leaves and 10 Citrus plants were placed inside of a rearing cage in the protected house. One curry leaf and one citrus plant kept outside of the cage but inside the protected house as controls. Approximately, 500 Diaphorina citri insects were collected from several Districts in Sri Lanka and kept in a secondary cage to facilitate the mating process for a week with one feeding plant. Insects were inserted into the main cage. After a month, all plants and some random insect samples were tested for the presence of Candidatus Liberibacter. Initially, all the curry leaves plants and citrus plants give negative results confirming the absence of CLas. After a month, one citrus plant was positive for the presence of CLas and other 9 citrus plants and curry plants produce negative results confirming the absence of CLas. Two random Diaphorina citri samples were checked. One sample was positive and the other one is negative for the presence of CLas. Results indicate that CLas is unable to survive in curry leaves plants, but further studies should be conducted. There is a potential to export fresh curry leaves, due to the absence of CLas in curry leaves.},

This insect has a host range of about 20 species of the family Rutaceae, including Citrus spp. However, there are a few studies related to their host preference. So, the aim of this project was to evaluate the behavior of the host choice of ACP comparing curry tree (Murraya koenigii) and ‘Valencia’ Sweet orange (Citrus sinensis). Therefore, we have investigated the effect of curry tree volatile on the behavior of D. citri through bioassays with olfactometer type 'Y'. This type of olfactometer is composed of a main pipe and two side glass tubes. Chambers containing the treatments were connected to the tubes. The treatment consisted of citrus plants and curry tree, containing shoots of the same size, and control (clean air). The attractiveness of both males and females, with defined ages, was evaluated. When citrus plants and curry tree were compared, it was observed that the females were more attracted to curry tree than citrus, which did not occur with the males. Subsequent studies will be conducted to collect the possible volatile involved on the process of the host selection of curry tree, looking for the achievement of attractiveness for D. citri management.},

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) Diaphorina citri, vector of ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (CLas), the putative causal agent of citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), is controlled by application of insecticides, which, although effective, has resulted in serious biological imbalances. New management tools are needed, and the technique known as “trap crop” has been attracting attention. A potential plant for use as a trap crop in the management of the ACP is Murraya koenigii (curry leaf). However, for this plant to be used in the field, it needs to be attractive for the vector and must not harbor CLas. To verify the potential of curry leaf as trap crop for the management of HLB, we investigated the ability of D. citri to transmit CLas to M. koenigii, and to other test plants, including M. paniculata (orange jasmine) and cultivar Valencia sweet-orange seedlings. For the tests, the insects were reared on a symptomatic CLas-infected plant and allowed to feed on the three test plant species. The overall maximum transmission rate for the citrus seedlings was 83.3\%, and for orange jasmine was 33.3\%. Successful transmission of CLas by ACP to the curry-leaf seedlings was not observed, and it was treated as immune to CLas. Supported by the previous results that M. koenigii is attractive for ACP, these results indicate that curry leaf is an excellent candidate for use as a trap crop, to improve the management of the insect vector and consequently of HLB.},

  abstract = {A detailed account is given of the history, aetiology, biology, epidemiology, detection, geographical distribution, and control of huanglongbing (HLB), a destructive disease of citrus that represents a major threat to the world citrus industry, and is slowly invading new citrusgrowing areas. HLB, whose name in Chinese means "yellow dragon disease", was first reported from southern China in 1919 and is now known to occur in next to 40 different Asian, African, Oceanian, South and North American countries. The agent is a phloem-restricted, non cultured, Gram-negative bacterium causing crippling diseases denoted "greening" in South Africa, "mottle leaf" in the Philippines, "dieback" in India, "vein phloem degeneration" in Indonesia. The HLB bacterium belongs to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter, three species of which are currently known, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, occurring in Asian countries and, to a lesser extent, in Brazil and the USA (Florida), Candidatus Liberibacter africanus with its subspecies "capensis", recorded from African countries, and Candidatus Liberibacter americanus present in Brazil. The suggestion is that each liberibacter species has evolved in the continent after which it is named. HLB symptoms are virtually the same wherever the disease occurs. Infected trees show a blotchy mottle condition of the leaves that results in the development of yellow shoots, the early and very characteristic symptom of the disease. Trees are stunted, declining and bear a few, small-sized, and deformed (lop-sided) fruits, that are poorly coloured (greening) and with coloration starting at the peduncular end (colour inversion). HLB can be transmitted by grafting from citrus to citrus and by dodder to periwinkle. The psyllids Trioza erytreae and Diaphorina citri are natural vectors. Two different types of HLB are known: the heat-sensitive African form transmitted by T. erytreae, which develops at temperatures of 22-25°C, and the heat-tolerant Asian form, transmitted by D. citri, which stands temperatures well above 30°C. Although the HLB pathogen can be identified by electron microscopy, other laboratory methods are used for routine detection. ELISA with monoclonal antibodies is not recommended. Better systems are dot blot hybridization with a DNA probe, and various PCR formats (one-step, nested, multiplex) using species-specific primers based on 16S rRNA or rplKAJL-rpoBC operon sequences. Because no curative methods of HLB are available, control is preventive and largely based on inoculum elimination by removal of infected trees and chemical treatments against vectors. Strict quarantine measures must be implemented to impair further international spread of HLB agents and their vectors.},

D. citri was discovered in southern Florida in 1998 and the HLB disease in 2005. Both have become established throughout citrus-producing areas of Florida. Murraya species are widely grown in southern Florida as ornamental hedges and are readily colonized by D. citri vectors. Colonies of D. citri, isolates of ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ from Taiwan and Florida, and the Murraya species were established in the BSL-3 biosecurity facility at Fort Detrick. In controlled inoculation experiments, D. citri transmitted ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ into M. paniculata (34/36 plants) and M. exotica (22/23 plants), but not into Bergera (Murraya) koenigii. Disease symptoms rarely developed in Murraya plants; however, positive infections were determined by conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Back-inoculations of ‘Ca.

Considerable variability was observed in infection rates, titer, and persistence of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ in infected Murraya.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ is transmitted by Diaphorina citri, an insect with a wide range of hosts in Rutaceae. Species related to Citrus occur in Brazilian forests where they may serve as hosts for psyllids and infested citrus orchards. RESULTS The suitability of plants as hosts of D. citri was classified into four groups. Group I (high suitability): Citrus × aurantium ‘Valencia’, ‘Citrus limonia’, Murraya paniculata (syn. Murraya exotica L.) (Aurantioideae: Aurantieae) and Bergera koenigii (Aurantioideae: Clauseneae). Group II (intermediate to low suitability): Citrus (Poncirus) trifoliata ‘Pomeroy’, Citrus wintersii, Swinglea glutinosa (Aurantieae) and Clausena lansium (Clauseneae). Group III (not suitable): Aegle marmelos, Atalantia buxifolia, Citrus (‘Microcitrus’) sp. (Aurantieae) and Helietta apiculata (Amyridoideae). Group IV (non-hosts): Glycosmis pentaphylla (Clauseneae), Balfourodendron riedelianum, Casimiroa edulis, Esenbeckia febrifuga, Esenbeckia leiocarpa, Metrodorea stipularis, Zanthoxylum rhoifolium (Amyridoideae) and Dictyoloma vandellianum (Cneoroideae). Insects survived longer on newly differentiated leaves compared with fully expanded soft leaves. Psyllids either did not develop or did not survive for long on most Group IV species, all of which, with the exception of G. pentaphylla, occur naturally in Brazilian forests. CONCLUSION Citrus relatives occurring in forests near citrus orchards are not suitable hosts of D. citri and, therefore, do not contribute to huanglongbing spread. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is a key pest of citrus associated with the yet uncurable Huanglongbing (HLB) disease, that is threatening worldwide citrus production. Control of D. citri has hitherto relied on chemical insecticides and on the use of the parasitoid Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). However, use of insecticides is problematic due to environmental and social issues, especially where D. citri is mostly spread in residential areas, and use of T. radiata has resulted in mixed success. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find sustainable and complementary practices to control this pest. Generalist predators, including green lacewings and coccinellids, have been frequently associated to D. citri in field surveys, yet they have rarely been tested. We have tested the predation capability under laboratory, greenhouse and semi-field conditions, of five predators: the green lacewings Chrysoperla comanche (Banks) and C. rufilabris Burmeister (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), the coccinellids Diomus pumilio Weise and Rhyzobius lophanthae (Blaisdell) (Cole­ optera: Coccinellidae) and the brown lacewing Sympherobius barberi Banks (Neuroptera: Hemerobiidae). All of them were capable of feeding on D. citri and reduce its populations under laboratory conditions, but critical differences emerged in greenhouse and field cages, with some predators (the green lacewings and D. pumilio) being the most effective. We discuss possible ways of utilizing these predators as an additional biological control tool to address current limitations of D. citri control in commercial groves, in residential areas and at the urbanagricultural interface.},

All commercially cultivated citrus is susceptible and varieties tolerant to disease expression are not yet available. Onset of disease occurs following a long latent period after inoculation, and thus the pathogen can spread widely prior to detection. Detection of the pathogen in Brazil in 2004 and Florida in 2005 catalyzed a significant increase in research on D. citri biology. Chemical control is the primary management strategy currently employed, but recently documented decreases in susceptibility of D. citri to several insecticides illustrate the need for more sustainable tools. Herein, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of D. citri biology and behavior, pathogen transmission biology, biological control, and chemical control with respect to “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus.” Our goal is to point toward integrated and biologically relevant management of this pathosystem.},

In Florida, Asian citrus psyllid was well established by the time of HLB discovery and growers did not remove trees to eliminate inoculum, so there was no chance of controlling the epidemic. Based on the Florida experience, Texas proactively controlled the vector by implementing area-wide management and disease spread was slower than in Florida, however, they also did not remove infected trees. California controlled both ACP and tree inoculum and have delayed the development of an epidemic in the Central Valley. This situation is aided by topographic isolation from the Los Angeles basin where ACP and HLB are endemic and a climate distinctly different from other citrus growing regions in the U.S.},

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), transmits the citrus greening pathogen ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (CLas) by feeding on citrus phloem sap. Because phloem sap is rich in sugars but low in amino acids, ACP sucks large quantities and excretes most of it as honeydew. We studied the chemical composition of ACP honeydew on various host plants. Honeydew samples were analyzed with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Fourteen sugars, 13 amino acids, and six organic acids were detected in the honeydew of ACP. Sugars composed about 95\% of the total compounds. Sucrose and trehalose were the predominant sugars, composing about 58 and 23\% of the total sugars, respectively. Proline, asparagine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid were the most abundant amino acids in ACP honeydew. The host plant and its infection with CLas had some effect on the honeydew composition. Glucose, chiro-inositol, myo-inositol, inositol, maltose, and turanose were lower in honeydew collected from CLas-infected citrus compared to that collected from non-infected trees. In CLas-infected citrus (pineapple sweet orange, Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) and Bergera koenigii (L.) Spreng. [curry leaf tree (both Rutaceae)] honeydews, valine, alanine, serine, glutamine, glycine, and the organic acids were lower than in honeydew from healthy citrus. Mannose, galactose, inositol, mannitol, an unknown disaccharide, and proline were higher in the honeydew collected from B. koenigii than in honeydew collected from healthy citrus (pineapple sweet orange), whereas fructose, chiro-inositol, myo-inositol, trehalose, and lactic acid were lower. The findings of this study help us understand the metabolism and the nutrient needs of ACP that transmits CLas, the pathogen of huanglongbing in citrus.},

  abstract = {In the northern distribution areas of the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri in Japan, psyllid population densities in citrus groves were much lower than on Murraya paniculata hedges. We investigated the preference of D. citri adults for M. paniculata and Citrus unshiu to interpret such different occurrences. When D. citri adults were released into a screen house containing potted M. paniculata and C. unshiu, the number of adults on both plants increased until the 4th day after release. Thereafter, the mean densities remained relatively constant for 18 days on each plant species before the start of new adult emergence. On most M. paniculata trees, new shoots were always produced by late December, and adult densities increased after the increase of new shoots and declined one or two months after the peak density. New shoots of C. unshiu available for D. citri reproduction were produced only once on two trees, on which adult densities become abundant after the growth of new shoots and decreased gradually until late December. On the other four C. unshiu trees, adults migrated from other trees and their densities remained relatively constant. When D. citri adults were introduced into a preference test chamber containing buds and leaves of C. unshiu and M. paniculata, the adults were significantly more aggregated on the buds than on the leaves of both plants. No preference between C. unshiu and M. paniculata for either buds or leaves was detected. The present experimental results suggested that the difference in the population levels of D. citri on C. unshiu and M. paniculata in their northern distribution areas was not caused by the preference of the insect, but may be due to continuous production of new shoots and dense planting of M. paniculata hedges favoring the reproduction and survival of D. citri during the typhoon season and winter.},

Trapping was conducted in March through May of 2013 and 2014 when psyllid populations usually are highest. Population levels of D. citri, based on the trapping data, varied among the sites, and there was a strong trend in both years for decreasing psyllid abundance with increased elevation based on the number of psyllids captured on traps and the proportion of trees shown to be infested. No psyllids were collected at an elevation of {$>$}600 m.

  abstract = {Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) is a phytophagous insect and the vector of the bacterium 'Candidatus' Liberibacter asiaticus. This is the likely causal pathogen of huanglongbing, which results in decline and possible death of citrus trees. It has been shown that host plants can affect the detoxification enzyme profile of arthropods. Here, we examined the effect of rearing D. citri on various host plant species with respect to activity of general esterases (ESTs), glutathione S-transferases (GST), and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s). These enzymes were selected because they are known to metabolize a wide diversity of insecticides and are known to directly contribute to resistance in D. citri. We reared D. citri on Citrus sinensis L., Bergera koenigii L. and Murraya paniculata (L.) Jacq. (Sapindales: Rutaceae). Following 12 generations of rearing, the activities of EST, GST, and P450 enzymes were compared between the colonies raised on the different host plants. The GST activity level was significantly higher in D. citri reared on M. paniculata than in those reared on C. sinensis. The P450 expression level was significantly higher in D. citri reared on M. paniculata than in those reared on either B. koenigii or C. sinensis. There was no significant difference in EST activity between treatments. These results suggest that host plant allelochemicals may alter the detoxification enzyme system in D. citri. However, these changes did not correlate with changes in mortality of D. citri when treated with fenpropathrin. Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) es un insecto fitófago y el vector de la bacteria 'Candidatus' Liberibacter asiaticus. Este es el patógeno causal probable de Huanglongbing, que resulta el declive y posible muerte de los árboles de cítricos. Se ha demostrado que las plantas hospederas pueden afectar el perfil de enzimas de desintoxicación de los artrópodos. Aquí, hemos examinado el efecto de críar D. citri sobre varias especies de plantas hospederas con respecto a la actividad de las esterasas generales (ESTs), glutatión S-transferasas (GST), y monooxigenasas del citocromo P450 (P450s). Estas enzimas fueron seleccionados porque son conocidos para metabolizar una amplia diversidad de insecticidas y se sabe que contribuyen directamente a la resistencia de D. citri. Se crió D. citri sobre Citrus sinensis L., Bergera koenigii L. y Murraya paniculata (L.) Jacq. (Sapindales: Rutaceae). Después de 12 generaciones de cría, se compararon las actividades de EST, GST y las enzimas P450 entre las colonias criadas sobre las diferentes plantas hospederas. El nivel de actividad GST fue significativamente mayor en D. citri criados sobre M. paniculata que en aquellos criados sobre C. sinensis. El nivel de expresión P450 fue significativamente mayor en D. citri criados en M. paniculata que en ambos B. koenigii o C. sinensis. No hubo una diferencia significativa en la actividad EST entre los tratamientos. Estos resultados sugieren que los aleloquímicos de plantas hospederas pueden alterar el sistema de enzimas de desintoxicación en D. citri. Sin embargo, estos cambios no se correlacionaron con cambios en la mortalidad de D. citri cuando son tratados con fenpropatrina.},

However, there is a paucity of information on its biology; hence, this study was conducted to evaluate survival and development on citrus, in this instance mandarin (Citrus reticulata) and curry leaf (Bergera koenigii), and transmission of ‘CLas’. Given its similarity with the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), sequences of the COI and 16S genes were examined to see if they could distinguish molecularly between nymphs of these two species. Field and laboratory experiments showed that D. communis nymphs transferred to mandarin branches failed to survive. Adults could survive on flush growth of ‘CLas’-infected mandarin trees; however, little oviposition took place, and the single resulting nymph did not survive to the second instar. These observations suggest that D. communis does not develop, or rarely develops on mandarin and possibly other Citrus spp. Curry leaf appears to be its preferred host, and complete development can take place, possibly exclusively, on this species. Studies on acquisition of ‘CLas’ by D. communis and possible transmission assessed in 2014 and 2015 using greenhouse-grown curry leaf and mandarin seedlings with naturally infected mandarin stumps as a source of ‘CLas’ indicated a low acquisition rate of ‘CLas’. In addition, although D. communis can acquire ‘CLas’, it either cannot transmit it or transmission is limited, and the pathogen may not multiply within the insect. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that differences in COI and 16S regions may prove useful for differentiating between early instar D. communis and D. citri nymphs when fifth instar nymphs and adults are not present on host plants.},

Although direct damage by the pest is seldom of economic importance, the insect is more notorious for its ability to vector the fastidious phloem-limited bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), the putative causal bacterium of Huanglongbing or Asian citrus greening disease. For many years, Trioza erytreae (Del Guercio) (Hemiptera: Triozidae) was known to be the main vector of the African citrus greening disease caused by Candidatus Liberibacter africanus (CLaf), but the recent arrival of D. citri on the continent adds to the dynamics of infection and spread of both diseases on mainland Africa. Following the recent report of the presence of D. citri in Tanzania, an additional delimiting survey was carried out in the region, focusing on Kenya, mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar to detect the presence and ascertain the extent of spread of D. citri.},

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, a vector of citrus huanglongbing, is now present in all citrus-producing states in the USA and Mexico. In addition to citrus, the insect can reproduce on several other plant species in the Rutaceae family; orange jasmine (Murraya spp.) and curry leaf (Bergera koenigii) are among its preferred hosts. There are several indigenous Rutaceae species in North America, and some are popular ornamentals. A study was therefore initiated to determine the suitability of some of these plants for feeding and development of the psyllid in choice and no-choice experiments. D. citri was found to reproduce successfully on Choisya ternata, C. arizonica and Helietta parvifolia in no-choice tests, but preferentially selected orange jasmine and curry leaf for feeding and reproduction, in choice tests. On Amyris madrensis, A. texana and Zanthoxylum fagara, adult psyllids laid eggs which hatched, but no successful nymphal development was recorded beyond the first instars. No oviposition was recorded on Esenbeckia berlandieri, Ptelea trifoliata and Casimiroa tetrameria, although adult psyllids were able to survive on these species for several days. Results showed that C. ternata, C. arizonica and H. parvifolia can serve host plants of D. citri and this constitutes the first report of these plants serving as host for D. citri. The findings of the present study suggest that native rutaceous host plants can serve as host plants and thus affect D. citri population dynamics and the epidemiology of Huanglongbing, the deadly citrus greening disease whose pathogen is vectored by D. citri. Thus, area-wide management of this pest also should target these riparian habitats where these host plants are present with D. citri biological control agents for sustainable management of this pest.},

The vector and the bacteria have host plants outside the genus Citrus, and these plants have the potential to affect disease epidemiology within citrus groves. Murraya paniculata could be especially problematic because it is a popular ornamental plant and a host of both psyllid and bacteria. We conducted a year-long survey of eight urban plantings of M. paniculata in east-central Florida to characterize ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ infection rates in plants and associated psyllids. Using sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) primers targeting two prophage genes of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’, we found infection to be extremely low: less than 1\% of psyllids and 1.8\% of plants. With qPCR primers targeting ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ 16S rDNA, none of the plants and only one psyllid were ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’-positive. Therefore, the titer of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ is low in M. paniculata and associated psyllids. These results suggest that urban plantings of M. paniculata may serve as a minor source of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ inoculum.},

A comprehensive understanding of molecular components that govern key physiological traits in D. citri would promote the development of novel genetic control strategies to fight this pest. In the present study, a transformer 2 homologue (Dctra-2) implicated in embryonic sex differentiation in dipteran insects is targeted to interfere with the offspring sex ratio of D. citri. The results of the present study show that Dctra-2 is constitutively expressed at all developmental stages and in both females and males during the adult stage. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirms the double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) of the Dctra-2. RNAi effects in D. citri female adults can be transferred in a trans-generational manner to their eggs and progeny, which are commonly referred as parental RNAi. RNAi females lay fewer eggs, with a mean of 12.44, and the hatching rate of laid eggs is reduced approximately by 29.86\% compared with the control. However, parental RNAi of Dctra-2 do not produce male-biased progeny. The results suggest that Dctra-2 is an effective RNAi target for use in the management of D. citri. In addition, the parental RNAi would provide an effective tool for studying the function of early embryonic genes in D. citri.},
