### Introduction

The Asian citrus psyllid, *Diaphorina citri* (Kuwayama) (Hemiptera: Liviidae) is one of the greatest threats to the citrus industry, because it acts as the primary vector for *Candidatus* Liberibacter asiaticus (*Alphaproteobacteria*), the bacteria which causes Citrus Greening Disease or Huanglongbing (HLB) [@Bove2006]. No cultivars of citrus have been found to be fully resistant to HLB [@Graham2020]. Infection eventually kills the host plant as bacteria damage the roots [@Johnson2014], causing branch necrosis, leaf yellowing, reduced tree yield, and poor development and quality of fruit [@Bove2006]. Current citriculture methods are unable to completely control the psyllid and/or HLB, but the integration of best practices may slow the progression of the disease [@Johnson2014a; @Graham2020]. The Dundee Biological Control Laboratory is primarily responsible for the rearing and release of *Tamarixia radiata*, a parasitoid wasp of *D. citri* nymphs [@Qureshi2014]. The production of our parasitoids used at FDACS-DPI is a synchronous rearing of wasps and psyllids, similar to those described by @Skelley2004 [@Kerr2014; @Kerr2016]. *D. citri* are raised on Orange Jasmine (*Murraya paniculata* (L.) Jack, Sapindales: Rutaceae) a true host of *D. citri* [@Cheema1975], partially due to their relative resistance to HLB [@Damsteegt2010: @Walter2012; @Walter2012a], their high rate of new flush after pruning [@Hall2014], as well as their relative attractiveness to *D. citri* [@Ikeda2008]. As the *D. citri* develop, *T. radiata* are introduced to parasitize the nymphs, and adult *T. radiata* are collected post emergence for future field release [@Kerr2016]. Although *M. paniculata* is recognized as a good host for rearing *D. citri*, the Curry Tree (*Bergera [Murraya] koenigii* (L.) Sprengel, Sapindales: Rutaceae), is thought to be an original (and preferred [@Chakrabarty1976; @Singh1977]) host plant of the Asian citrus psyllid [@Qureshi2020]. In addition, *B. koenigii* is thought to be fully resistant to HLB [@Alves2021; @Athukorala2020; @Beloti2018]. Its volatiles are similar to those of *M. paniculata* [@Yan2015], but are more attractive for *D. citri* [@Beloti2017], to the point where this plant has also been considered for its potential as a trap crop [@Marsh2016].

### Methods


### Results

Here you may have some figures to show off, bellow I have made a scatterplot with the infamous Iris dataset and I can even reference to the figure automatically like this, `Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure)`, Figure \@ref(fig:irisfigure).

<!-- ```{r, irisfigure, fig.cap='Here is a caption for the figure. This can be added by using the "fig.cap" option in the r code chunk options, see this [link](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#plots) from the legend himself, [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui).', out.width="80%"} -->
<!-- par(mar=c(2,2,0,1)) -->
<!-- plot(x = iris$Sepal.Length, y = iris$Sepal.Width, -->
<!--      col = iris$Species, pch = 19, xlab = "Sepal Length", -->
<!--      ylab = "Sepal Width") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Maybe you want to show off some of that fancy code you spent so much time on to make that figure, well you can do that too! Just use the `echo=TRUE` option in the r code chunk options, Figure \@ref(fig:myprettycode)! -->

```{r myprettycode, echo=FALSE,collapse=TRUE, fig.cap='Boxplots, so hot right now!', fig.height=3.5, out.width="80%"}
#trim whitespace
par(mar=c(2,2,0,0))
#plot boxplots
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Species,
        col = "#008080", 
        border = "#0b4545",
        ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)",
        xlab = "Species")
```

<!-- How about a neat table of data? See, Table \@ref(tab:iristable): -->

<!-- ```{r, iristable} -->
<!-- knitr::kable( -->
<!--   iris[1:8,1:5], format = "html", -->
<!--   caption = "A table made with the **knitr::kable** function.", -->
<!--   align = "c", col.names = c("Sepal <br> Length", -->
<!--                              "Sepal <br> Width", -->
<!--                              "Petal <br> Length", -->
<!--                              "Petal <br> Width", -->
<!--                              "Species"), -->
<!--   escape = FALSE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
