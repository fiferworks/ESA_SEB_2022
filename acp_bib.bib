  abstract = {The effect of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (BB-12) on the biological characteristics of Tamarixia radiata parasitizing Diaphorina citri was studied under laboratory conditions. Twenty 3rd–5th instar nymphs were exposed to a single already-mated female parasitoid (1 day old) and removed after 24 h. Subsequently, the nymphs were sprayed at 1, 24 and 48 h post-exposure with 1 × 108 conidial mL−1 suspension. The percentage of parasitism recorded was 22\%, 35\% and 41\% at 1, 24 and 48 h, respectively. The emergence rate varied between 28\%, 51\% and 49\% at 1, 24 and 48 h, respectively. In a subsequent experiment, nymphs of D. citri were sprayed with 1 × 108 conidial mL−1 suspension and then exposed to T. radiata at 1, 24 and 48 h post-spraying to allow for parasitism to occur. The percentage of parasitism recorded was 18\%, 27\% and 28\% at 1, 24 and 48 h, respectively, significantly lower than the parasitism rate recorded in the control (48\%). The percentage of emergence varied between 24\%, 44\% and 45\% at 1, 24 and 48 h, respectively. In both experiments, no significant difference was observed in the pre-adult duration (days) and the sex ratio of F1 generation. Meanwhile, significant differences were observed in the longevity of the F1 generation of females and males of T. radiata in a treatment consisting of spraying the fungal suspension and the control. Overall, the findings of the current study revealed a negative interaction between T. radiata and B. bassiana in controlling D. citri nymphs. This outcome is believed to be a result of the antagonistic effects of B. bassiana on the developmental process of the pre-adult stages of the parasitoid. However, our results also show that with a properly timed application (allowing parasitism to occur over an extended period of time before the application of the fungus), T. radiata could potentially be used in combination with B. bassiana for the successful biological control of D. citri. This should be carried out in order to minimize the potentially negative interactions between these two biological agents.},

The biological control efficacy of T. radiata was evaluated by linking the age-stage predation rate with the two-sex life table. The net host-feeding rate (C0) by T. radiata was 32.05, 54.40, 17.25, and 1.92 nymphs per female parasitoid at 20, 27.5, 30, and 35°C, respectively. The total net nymphs killing rate (Z0) was 103.02, 223.82, 72.95, and 6.60 nymphs per female parasitoid at 20, 27.5, 30, and 35°C, respectively. Noneffective parasitism rate was observed at 35°C because of high mortality at this temperature. Our results indicated that temperature had meaningful effects on parasitism and host-feeding rate parameters in the laboratory, and may affect biological control efficiency of the parasitoid in the field. The highest host-feeding rate and total biological control efficiency of T. radiata were recorded at 27.5°C. Most importantly, we found that host-feeding activity of the parasitoid is temperature-dependent, and changed across temperature regimes: the host-feeding rate increased as the temperature increased up to 30°C, started to decrease after this temperature and declined to its minimum level at 35°C. This information is valuable for developing biological control and integrated pest management techniques for Asian citrus psyllid management.},

  abstract = {Tetranychus urticae (T. urticae) Koch is a cosmopolitan, polyphagous mite which causes economic losses in both agricultural and ornamental plants. Some traits of T. urticae hamper its management, including a short life cycle, arrhenotokous parthenogenesis, its haplodiploid sex determination system, and its extraordinary ability to adapt to different hosts and environmental conditions. Currently, the use of chemical and biological control are the major control methods used against this mite. In recent years, some studies have focused on plant defence mechanisms against herbivores. Various families of plant compounds (such as flavonoids, glucosinolates, or acyl sugars) have been shown to behave as acaricides. Plants can be induced upon appropriate stimuli to increase their resistance against spider mites. This knowledge, together with the understanding of mechanisms by which T. urticae detoxifies and adapts to pesticides, may complement the control of this pest. Herein, we describe plant volatile compounds (VOCs) with repellent activity, and new findings about defence priming against spider mites, which interfere with the T. urticae performance. The use of VOCs and defence priming can be integrated into current management practices and reduce the damage caused by T. urticae in the field by implementing new, more sustainable crop management tools.},

  abstract = {African citrus greening (ACGD) and huanglongbing (HLB) diseases are the most damaging diseases of citrus worldwide. Currently, the disease has no cure and has been attributed to the collapse of the citrus industry in several countries. In Africa, the causative agent “Candidatus” Liberibacter africanus is vectored by African citrus triozid (ACT) Trioza erytreae Del Guercio (Hemiptera: Triozidae). African citrus triozid is native to Africa but has been recently reported in Asia and Europe. Apart from citrus, Murraya koenigii (L.) and Clausena anisata (Willd) Hook. F. ex Benth. are also considered as preferred host plants. At present, there is scant information on host plant suitability and preference of T. erytreae. Also, there are contradictory reports on its reproduction and survival on rutaceous and non-rutaceous host plants. In the present study, we tested the suitability and preference of rutaceous and non-rutaceous trees and shrubs as potential ACT host plants in choice and no-choice bioassays. The development from egg to the adult stage was longest on Calodendrum capense (Wright \& Arn.) Engl. Host plants of superior quality accordingly to several ACT's biological parameters measured also revealed significantly higher morphometric characteristics. Our findings on the host status of the five rutaceous plants imply that these plants can greatly influence the population dynamics of ACT as well as the epidemiology of ACGD, and these can be a useful guide in the area-wide management of the pest in Kenya.}

Presently, biological data on T. erytreae are insufficient for important parameters like distribution, seasonal dynamics and entomopathogens. Therefore, we determined the temporal dynamics of T. erytreae along three different altitudinal gradients in Kenya. In low altitudes, females of T. erytreae reactivated and started laying eggs between late February and early March. The mean monthly number of immature stages of T. erytreae per flush shoot peaked in February, whereas adults peaked in March. For mid-altitudes, T. erytreae mean populations peaked in February, but adults were already present in December. In high altitudes, adults appeared in June, and females began laying eggs. Trioza erytreae population densities in shaded trees positively and significantly correlated with unshaded trees. There was a significant difference between adult density and maximum temperature, average temperature, solar radiation, evaporation and dew point. Furthermore, this study evaluated the effects of 11 Metarhizium anisopliae and 4 Beauveria bassiana fungal isolates against adult T. erytreae under laboratory conditions. Metarhizium anisopliae ICIPE 18 and ICIPE 69 were the most potent isolates, causing 97.5\% and 82.5\% mortalities within the shortest LT50 time of 4.4 and 5.9 days, respectively. The presence of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) on Zanthozylum capense requires further investigation. Our findings provide relevant information for early detection, monitoring and developing biopesticides against the pest.},

From natural populations we selected three spider mite strains from two species, Tetranychus urticae and Tetranychus evansi, that can suppress plant defenses, using a fourth defense-inducing strain as a benchmark, to assess to which extent these strains suppress defenses differently. We characterized timing and magnitude of phytohormone accumulation and defense-gene expression, and determined if mites that cannot suppress defenses benefit from sharing a leaf with suppressors. The nonsuppressor strain induced a mixture of jasmonate- (JA) and salicylate (SA)-dependent defenses. Induced defense genes separated into three groups: ‘early’ (expression peak at 1 d postinfestation (dpi)); ‘intermediate’ (4 dpi); and ‘late’, whose expression increased until the leaf died. The T. evansi strains suppressed genes from all three groups, but the T. urticae strain only suppressed the late ones. Suppression occurred downstream of JA and SA accumulation, independently of the JA–SA antagonism, and was powerful enough to boost the reproductive performance of nonsuppressors up to 45\%. Our results show that suppressing defenses not only brings benefits but, within herbivore communities, can also generate a considerable ecological cost when promoting the population growth of a competitor.},

Mechanical inoculation of infected material in indicator plants for viruses, Chenopodium ambrosioides, Amaranthus deflexus and Chenopodium quinoa induced typical symptoms confirming the infection by Coffee ringspot virus (CoRSV). This is the first record of CoRSV in Western Bahia, indicating that this virus probably is present in all coffee plantations of the region, established in places with higher temperatures, since this is a factor considered ideal for viral multiplication.},

  abstract = {The knowledge of pest dispersal is crucial for understanding the dynamics of resistance to pesticides. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to study the dispersal of Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes) under laboratory, greenhouse and citrus groves conditions. Dispersal studies of B. phoenicis on sandy surface conducted under greenhouse conditions showed that dispersal capacity by crawling is relatively limited. After the release of 6,000 mites in one point, approximately 3\% reached distances of 40 to 50 cm from the release point. This mite moved less than 1 cm.day-1. Wind speed of 23 km.h-1 was not enough to trigger mite dispersal from the surface of citrus fruits under laboratory conditions. Wind speeds of 30 and 40 km.h-1 were capable to trigger the dispersal of less than 1\% of mites on fruits. Mite dispersal studies with the use of sticky traps under field conditions also showed that B. phoenicis dispersal is limited when compared to other mite species from citrus groves. In this experiment, from a total of 2,420 and 661 mites collected from each of two citrus fields in Descalvado, region, State of São Paulo, Brazil, 0.4 and 11.8\% of the mites belonged to the family Tenuipalpidae. The limited dispersal of B. phoenicis requires considerable attention in the establishment of acaricide resistance management strategies. Leprosis mite; acaricide resistance; aerial dispersal},

This study evaluated the influence of five commercial varieties of citrus (Citrus spp. L.)—Hamlin, Natal, Pêra, Ponkan, and Valencia—and orange jasmine [Murraya exotica (L.) Jack] on the development of D. citri. Survival rates for the egg stage were highest on orange jasmine (85.7\%) and on Valencia (83.3\%). The lowest viability of the nymphal stage was also observed on Hamlin, averaging 57.4\%. Values for total viability ranged from 65.9 to 32.6\%, and were highest on Valencia. The longest egg–adult development time was on Natal, with a mean of 18.4 d; the shortest total development time was on orange jasmine, with a mean of 17.3 d. Based on the fertility life table, the net reproductive rate (Ro) of D. citri was 2.5 times higher when reared on Valencia than on Hamlin. The other parameters (duration of each generation [T], finite rate of increase [λ], and innate capacity to increase in number [rm]) also demonstrated that Valencia is best suited to this insect. The results obtained for the biological parameters and the fertility life table indicate that Valencia and orange jasmine were the most suitable hosts, whereas Hamlin was least suitable for the development of D. citri. These results provide information for the installation of new citrus groves, especially in the choice of varieties to be planted and the location of different varieties within the groves, with a view toward the management of Huanglongbing or HLB.},

  abstract = {Huanglongbing is a highly destructive citrus disease associated with “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” (Las), a phloem−limited and non-culturable bacterium, naturally transmitted by the psyllid Diaphorina citri. Although diverse approaches have been used to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogen–host interaction, such approaches have focused on already infected and/or symptomatic plants, missing early events in the initial days post-inoculation. This study aimed to identify the time course of Las multiplication and whole-plant colonization immediately following inoculation by infected psyllids feeding for 2 days. Thus, the experimental approach was to track Las titers after psyllid inoculation in new shoots (NS) of Citrus × sinensis (susceptible), Murraya paniculata (partially resistant), and Bergera koenigii (fully resistant). Soon after psyllid removal, Las titers dropped until the 10–12th days in all three species. Following this, Las titers increased exponentially only in C. × sinensis and M. paniculata, indicating active bacterial multiplication. In C. × sinensis, Las reached a stationary phase at ∼5 log Las cells/g of tissue from the 40th day onward, while in M. paniculata, Las increased at a lower rate of up to ∼3 log Las cells/g of tissue between the 40th and 60th days, decreasing gradually thereafter and becoming undetectable from the 160th day onward. In B. koenigii, Las titers decreased from the start and remained undetectable. In C. × sinensis, an average of 2.6 log of Las cells/g of tissue was necessary for Las to move out of 50\% of the NS in 23.6 days and to colonize the rest of the plant, causing a successful infection. Conversely, the probability of Las moving out of the NS remained below 50\% in M. paniculata and zero in B. koenigii. To our knowledge, this is the first study on Las dynamics and whole-plant colonization during the earliest stages of infection. Identification of critical time-points for either successful multiplication or Las resistance may help to elucidate initial events of Las–host interactions that may be missed due to longer sampling intervals and at later stages of infection.},

Knowing the biology of this mite species when under chemical control is extremely important to understand its population dynamics, and then to solve problems of management of this pest. Therefore, we assessed the effects of one sublethal dose of spirodiclofen (0.48 ppm) on biological and demographic parameters of B. yothersi under laboratory and greenhouse conditions, comparing them with non-exposed mite population. RESULTS Under laboratory conditions, where citrus fruits were used as a substrate, the duration of developmental stages (pre-egg-laying and egg-laying) and mite longevity showed no differences between treatments. However, the number of laid eggs increased in acaricide-treated fruits. In the greenhouse experiment, where citrus plants were used as a substrate, the instantaneous growth rate (ri) of mites was positive in all untreated plots. In contrast, in treated plants, ri was negative in 12 experimental units, and mite populations were suppressed in five of them. Moreover, mite population dynamics had a positive ri in three treated plants. CONCLUSIONS Spirodiclofen sublethal dose had no negative effect on the offspring of B. yothersi females. However, it is not safe for citrus leprosis mite since it may increase egg number per female in some conditions. Biological and demographic differences could influence mite population dynamics in the field, requiring appropriate management strategies to improve citrus leprosis control.  2019 Society of Chemical Industry}

In Brazil it is already present in several regions and has a high potential for dispersion to other regions, which could severely affect the cultivation of coconuts, bananas, native and exotic palm trees, and tropical flowers, such as those of the Heliconiaceae family. Thus, we aimed to determine the regions of Brazil most prone to the occurrence of R. indica using Maxent with updated data on its occurrence and a selection of bioclimatic variables that may influence its establishment. The occurrence data used were obtained through a literature search, online databases, and surveys carried out in the field. The model indicated a high potential for the establishment of R. indica in the following locations: a large part of the State of Roraima, the eastern part of the State of Amazonas, the northern and central-western parts of the State of Pará, and parts of the states of Acre and Amapá (North Region); the coast of Brazil from Rio Grande do Norte to the states of Paraíba, Pernanbuco, Alagoas, Sergipe and Bahia (Northeast Region); the states of Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo, the far east of Minas Gerais, and almost the entire state of São Paulo, except the northern part (Southeast Region); most of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul and the most southern portion of the State of Mato Grosso (Midwest Region); and the northern part of the State of Paraná and small parts of the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (South Region). The bioclimatic variables that most influenced the potential geographical distribution of R. indica were precipitation of driest month (Bio14), precipitation of wettest month (Bio13), mean diurnal range (Bio2), and isothermality (Bio3). The parameterization for the Maxent model provides an updated model to prevention invasion of R. indica due updated data on its occurrence used. Thus, potential geographic distribution of R. indica in Brazil should be consider from this study.}

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, is currently the most important pest of citrus worldwide because it vectors ‘Candidatus Liberibacter’ spp., the etiological agents of lethal Huanglongbing (HLB). Reduction of D. citri populations is a key component of HLB management. Identifying potential D. citri attractants, such as volatiles, could be useful for behavioral management of this insect. This could, for instance, enhance catches of adults on monitoring traps. The overall aim of this study was to investigate the response of D. citri to volatiles characteristic of preferred citrus hosts. An ancillary objective was to formulate a synthetic blend of volatiles based on preferred host odors that could enhance monitoring traps. Volatile collections of two preferred citrus species, Duncan grapefruit (Citrus paradise) and sweet orange (Citrus sinensis), were performed in aeration chambers and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Based on the grapefruit volatile profile, a synthetic blend consisting in D-limonene (0.62 mg), methyl N-methylanthranilate (0.19 mg), β-ocimene (0.11 mg), β-elemene (0.02 mg), and β-caryophyllene (0.02 mg) was prepared in 9.9 mL of dichloromethane and evaluated for attractiveness, as well as the individual compounds, and compared with a positive control of natural volatiles collected from Citrus sinensis. Behavior of D. citri adults was evaluated in two-choice behavioral assays comparing response to lures with different combinations and dosages of the volatiles deployed on yellow sticky traps. Individually, neither D-limonene nor methyl N-methylanthranilate affected behavior of D. citri. However, these volatiles increased catches of D. citri, as compared with solvent control, when presented as components of the synthetic grapefruit blend, as did the natural citrus odor positive control. Importantly, catch of D. citri appeared to vary with the release rate of the identified grapefruit volatile blend, which was attractive at a 0.1 mg loading dosage, but repellent at a dosage only 1 log step higher.},

  abstract = {Ants are one of the most abundant insect groups in citrus orchards. They help in controlling pests, but they can also facilitate the outbreak of other pests, such as those that produce honeydew. Moreover, ants can also affect natural enemies of pests. Here, we review how ants affect pest abundance, considering whether the pest produces hon­ eydew and whether it spends part of its life-cycle in the soil (edaphic stages). We also investigated the effects of the presence of ants on natural enemies with a meta-analysis and how this effect is modified by honeydew production by the pest, the most abundant ant species, and the specialization and mode of dispersal (winged or wingless) of the natural enemy. The presence of ants decreased the abundance of non-honeydew producing pests, but increased the abundance of honeydew producers. Ants increased the abundance of pests without edaphic stages, but decreased pests with such stages. In addition, the identity of the most abundant ant species affected the abundance of natural enemies; the ants Iridomyrmex rufoniger and Lasius grandis had a negative impact whereas other ant species did not affect the abundance of natural enemies. Moreover, the presence of ants decreased the abundance of generalist and winged natural enemies of honeydew-producing pests. Our review provides crucial information on the effects of ants on biological control practices in citrus orchards, and increases our understanding of the relationships between ants, pests and their natural enemies.},

Seven genera are included in a phylogenetic analysis for the first time. Most clades are resolved with high support, and we propose a new subfamily classification for Rutaceae that comprises the subfamilies Amyridoideae, Aurantioideae, Cneoroideae, Haplophylloideae, Rutoideae and Zanthoxyloideae. Aurantioideae is the only traditional subfamily that is resolved as monophyletic. We tested whether 13 morphological and karyological characters are taxonomically informative in Rutaceae. Chromosome numbers are clearly different in the two main clades of Rutaceae, but fruit characteristics, which have been used to define subfamilies in the past, do not distinguish between the main lineages of the family.},

  abstract = {Leprosis is a serious disease of citrus caused by Citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C, genus Cilevirus) whose transmission is mediated by false spider mites of the genus Brevipalpus. CiLV-C infection does not systemically spread in any of its known host plants, thus remaining restricted to local lesions around the feeding sites of viruliferous mites. To get insight into this unusual pathosystem, we evaluated the expression profiles of genes involved in defense mechanisms of Arabidopsis thaliana and Citrus sinensis upon infestation with non-viruliferous and viruliferous mites by using reverse-transcription qPCR. These results were analyzed together with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the appearance of dead cells as assessed by histochemical assays. After interaction with non-viruliferous mites, plants locally accumulated ROS and triggered the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonate/ethylene (JA/ET) pathways. ERF branch of the JA/ET pathways was highly activated. In contrast, JA pathway genes were markedly suppressed upon the CiLV-C infection mediated by viruliferous mites. Viral infection also intensified the ROS burst and cell death, and enhanced the expression of genes involved in the RNA silencing mechanism and SA pathway. After 13 days of infestation of two sets of Arabidopsis plants with non-viruliferous and viruliferous mites, the number of mites in the CiLV-C infected Arabidopsis plants was significantly higher than in those infested with the non-viruliferous ones. Oviposition of the viruliferous mites occurred preferentially in the CiLV-C infected leaves. Based on these results, we postulated the first model of plant/Brevipalpus mite/cilevirus interaction in which cells surrounding the feeding sites of viruliferous mites typify the outcome of a hypersensitive-like response, whereas viral infection induces changes in the behavior of its vector.},

  abstract = {False-spider mites of the genus Brevipalpus are highly polyphagous pests that attack hundreds of plant species of distinct families worldwide. Besides causing direct damage, these mites may also act as vectors of many plant viruses that threaten high-value ornamental plants like orchids and economically important crops such as citrus and coffee. To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind plant-mite interaction we used an RNA-Seq approach to assess the global response of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) plants along the course of the infestation with Brevipalpus yothersi, the main vector species within the genus. Mite infestation triggered a drastic transcriptome reprogramming soon at the beginning of the interaction and throughout the time course, deregulating 1755, 3069 and 2680 genes at 6 hours after infestation (hai), 2 days after infestation (dai), and 6 dai, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a clear modulation of processes related to the plant immune system. Co-expressed genes correlated with specific classes of transcription factors regulating defense pathways and developmental processes. Up-regulation of defensive responses correlated with the down-regulation of growth-related processes, suggesting the triggering of the growth-defense crosstalk to optimize plant fitness. Biological processes (BPs) enriched at all time points were markedly related to defense against herbivores and other biotic stresses involving the defense hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Levels of both hormones were higher in plants challenged with mites than in the non-infested ones, supporting the simultaneous induction of genes from both pathways. To further clarify the functional relevance of the plant hormonal pathways on the interaction, we evaluated the mite performance on Arabidopsis mutants impaired in SA- or JA-mediated response. Mite oviposition was lower on mutants defective in SA biosynthesis (sid2) and signaling (npr1), showing a function for SA pathway in improving the mite reproduction, an unusual mechanism compared to closely-related spider mites. Here we provide the first report on the global and dynamic plant transcriptome triggered by Brevipalpus feeding, extending our knowledge on plant-mite interaction. Furthermore, our results suggest that Brevipalpus mites manipulate the plant defensive response to render the plant more susceptible to their colonization by inducing the SA-mediated pathway.},

Molecular diagnostic tools provide valuable support for the rapid and accurate identification of morphologically indistinct alien species. However, these tools currently lack standardization. They are not conducive to adaptation by multiple sectors or countries, or to coping with changing pest priorities. The data presented here identifies DNA barcodes as a very promising opportunity to address this. DNA of tussock moth and fruit fly specimens intercepted at the New Zealand border over the last decade were reanalysed using the cox1 sequence barcode approach. Species identifications were compared with the historical dataset obtained by PCR–RFLP of nuclear rDNA. There was 90 and 96\% agreement between the methods for these species, respectively. Improvements included previous tussock moth ‘unknowns’ being placed to family, genera or species and further resolution within fruit fly species complexes. The analyses highlight several advantages of DNA barcodes, especially their adaptability and predictive value. This approach is a realistic platform on which to build a much more flexible system, with the potential to be adopted globally for the rapid and accurate identification of invasive alien species.},

Despite this, there is limited information known on their basic biology, such as species status and reproductive modes, making it difficult to develop effective and sustainable control strategies. The species/strain status of Balaustium and Bryobia mites from southern Australia was examined using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data. In addition, the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method was used to examine the reproductive mode and genetic diversity of Ba. medicagoense from 16 populations within southern Australia. Results indicate that there is only one species of Balaustium (Ba. medicagoense) and as many as seven species of Bryobia mites currently present in grain crops, pastures and roadsides within southern Australia. The Bryobia species complex consists of four recently described lineages (Bryobia sp. I, Bryobia sp. IV, Bryobia sp. VII, and Bryobia praetiosa Koch) and three additional genetic lineages (Bryobia sp. VIII, Bryobia sp. IX, and Bryobia sp. X) that have not been described previously. Bryobia sp. VIII, B. sp. IX, and B. sp. I seem to be the most abundant species present in Australian broadacre agriculture (i.e., land suitable for farms practicing large-scale crop [agriculture] operations). The AFLP data revealed that Ba. medicagoense reproduces asexually and that genetic diversity was low with only 10 genotypes found. These findings indicate a new complex of pest mites are present within Australian grain crops and pastures and this has implications for their control.}

Updated information and regional exploration on biocontrol pests are important elements for effective disease management strategies. In this study, the diversity and parasitism rate of T. radiata populations were evaluated. Due to the importance of the host–parasitoid relationship, the presence of Wolbachia as an endosymbiont was also investigated. The parasitism rate of various T. radiata populations from Ecuador and China ranged between 57.27\% and 66.32\%, respectively, with a non-significant emergence rate and a statistically similar sex ratio. Sequence analysis of ITS and COI from T. radiata populations was consistent with the morphological hypothesis that the collections represent a single species, whereas phylogeny of the wsp gene confirmed the presence of Wolbachia pipientis as an endosymbiont within T. radiata populations. Based on partial COI sequences, the maximum genetic diversity such as total haplotype diversity (Hd = 0.788), nucleotide, diversity (π = 0.2439), and average nucleotide difference (k = 171.844) was also estimated for different T. radiata populations. Furthermore, neutrality tests based on COI sequences indicated an overall contraction in T. radiata populations, whereas an expansion trend was observed in associated W. pipientis strains. This study clearly demonstrated the presence of genetically diverse T. radiata populations that were able to parasitize D. citri effectively, and these can be further explored as promising biocontrol candidates in integrated pest management strategies to solve citriculture economic loss caused by D. citri.},

On tomato plants, most genotypes of the herbivorous generalist spider mite Tetranychus urticae induce JA defenses and perform poorly on it, whereas the Solanaceae specialist Tetranychus evansi, who suppresses JA defenses, performs well on it. We asked to which extent these spider mites and the predatory mite Phytoseiulus longipes preying on these spider mites eggs are affected by induced JA-defenses. By artificially inducing the JA-response of the tomato JA-biosynthesis mutant def-1 using exogenous JA and isoleucine (Ile), we first established the relationship between endogenous JA-Ile-levels and the reproductive performance of spider mites. For both mite species we observed that they produced more eggs when levels of JA-Ile were low. Subsequently, we allowed predatory mites to prey on spider mite-eggs derived from wild-type tomato plants, def-1 and JA-Ile-treated def-1 and observed that they preferred, and consumed more, eggs produced on tomato plants with weak JA defenses. However, predatory mite oviposition was similar across treatments. Our results show that induced JA-responses negatively affect spider mite performance, but positively affect the survival of their offspring by constraining egg-predation.},

  abstract = {In 2015 the European Union banned importing fresh curry leaves from Sri Lanka due to Citrus greening disease reported in Sri Lanka. Citrus greening is the most dangerous disease in citrus cultivation. The disease is caused by the infection of non-culturable bacteria named Candidatus Liberibacter (CLas). This bacterium transferred by a vector named Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri). Asian citrus psyllid is one of the major pests in Curry leaves. This study was conducted to confirm the existence of Candidatus Liberibacter in Curry leaves by conducting a pathogenicity test to test the ability of CLas to cause the disease. 11 Citrus plants and 11 Curry leaves plants were tested for Candidatus Liberibacter. The presence of CLas in leaf samples were identified by amplification of 1160 bp fragment of 16s rRNA. 10 Curry leaves and 10 Citrus plants were placed inside of a rearing cage in the protected house. One curry leaf and one citrus plant kept outside of the cage but inside the protected house as controls. Approximately, 500 Diaphorina citri insects were collected from several Districts in Sri Lanka and kept in a secondary cage to facilitate the mating process for a week with one feeding plant. Insects were inserted into the main cage. After a month, all plants and some random insect samples were tested for the presence of Candidatus Liberibacter. Initially, all the curry leaves plants and citrus plants give negative results confirming the absence of CLas. After a month, one citrus plant was positive for the presence of CLas and other 9 citrus plants and curry plants produce negative results confirming the absence of CLas. Two random Diaphorina citri samples were checked. One sample was positive and the other one is negative for the presence of CLas. Results indicate that CLas is unable to survive in curry leaves plants, but further studies should be conducted. There is a potential to export fresh curry leaves, due to the absence of CLas in curry leaves.},

Four leaf sections or three leaf sections and one yellow tag were placed together in a Petri dish chamber. One to four of the leaf sections or the yellow tag was sprayed with I. fumosorosea (1.2 - 1.7 × 103 blastospores/mm2). After treatments dried, a single adult psyllid was released into each chamber. Mortality due to I. fumosorosea for the adult psyllid was observed 4.9 ± 0.21- 6.1 ± 0.37 d following exposure to the pathogen. The rate of colonization by I. fumosorosea on adults in chambers with untreated leaf sections and one treated yellow tag was as effective in inducing mortality as in chambers with one treated leaf section at 8 days post application. Under high humidity, I. fumosorosea blastospores readily produced hyphae on the surface of leaves, which was useful for determining if adults were responsible for transmission of the fungus. In chambers with a single treated leaf section, adults came into contact with blastospores and moved these around to the non-treated leaves. The same phenomenon, of psyllid infection and subsequent spreading of the fungus to non-treated leaves, was observed when psyllids were placed into chambers with a treated yellow tag. The use of I. fumosorosea inoculated yellow tags has potential as a psyllid dissemination technique for managing pest populations.},

This study evaluated the effect of foliar application of Acibenzolar S-methyl (ASM), a plant systemic acquired resistance inducer in reducing RRD disease severity on Rosa species cv. Radtkopink (Pink Double Knock Out®) under greenhouse condition, and the effect of ASM on plant growth under commercial nursery production conditions. ASM at 50 or 100 mg/L at weekly intervals significantly reduced RRD severity compared to the untreated control in two of the three greenhouse trials (P 0.05). The plants in these trials were subsequently pruned and observed for symptoms, which further indicated that application of ASM at 50 or 100 mg/L lowered disease severity compared to the untreated control (P 0.05) in these two trials. Plants treated with ASM at 50 or 100 mg/L had delayed incidence of RRD compared to the non-treated controls. Plants treated with ASM at 50 or 100 mg/L rate in all three trials either did not have RRV present or the virus was present in fewer leaf samples than untreated controls as indicated by RT-qPCR analysis. Overall, plants treated with ASM at 50 mg/L had 36-43\% reduced RRD incidence compared to the water control. The treatment of two cultivars of rose, ‘Radtkopink’ and ‘Meijocos’ (Pink Drift®), with weekly foliar applications of ASM at three rates (0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 oz/A) indicated that ASM had no negative effect on flowering or plant growth at even the highest rate.},

  abstract = {Jasmonic acid (JA) is thought to be part of a signal-transduction pathway which dramatically increases de-novo nicotine synthesis in the roots and increases whole-plant (WP) nicotine pools in response to the wounding of the leaves in Nicotiana sylvestrisSpegazzini and Comes (Solanaceae). We report the synthesis of a doubly labeled JA ([1, 2-13C]JA) and use it as an internal standard to quantify by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry the changes in root and shoot JA pools in plants subjected to differing amounts of standardized leaf wounding. Wounding increased JA pools 10-fold locally in damaged leaves within 90\textbackslash hspace0.167emmin and systemically in the roots (3.5-fold) 180\textbackslash hspace0.167emmin after wounding. If JA functions as an intermediary between stimulus and response, quantitative relationships among the stimulus, JA, and the response should exist. To examine these relationships, we varied the number of punctures in four leaves and quantified both the resulting JA in damaged leaves after 90\textbackslash hspace0.167emmin and the resulting WP nicotine concentration after 5 d. We found statistically significant, positive relationships among number of leaf punctures, endogenous JA, and WP nicotine accumulation. We used two inhibitors of wound-induced nicotine production, methyl salicylate and indole-3-acetic acid, to manipulate the relationships between wound-induced changes in JA and WP nicotine accumulation. Since wounding and the response to wounding occur in widely separated tissues, we applied inhibitors to different plant parts to examine their effects on the local and systemic components of this response. In all experiments, inhibition of the wound-induced increase in leaf JA 90\textbackslash hspace0.167emmin after wounding was associated with the inhibition of the nicotine response 5 d after wounding. We conclude that wound-induced increases in leaf JA are an important component of this long-distance signal-transduction pathway.},

  abstract = {Nectar-feeding animals can use vision and olfaction to find rewarding flowers and different species may give different weight to the two sensory modalities. We have studied how a diurnal or nocturnal lifestyle affects the weight given to vision and olfaction. We tested naïve hawkmoths of two species in a wind tunnel, presenting an odour source and a visual stimulus. Although the two species belong to the same subfamily of sphingids, the Macroglossinae, their behaviour was quite different. The nocturnal Deilephila elpenor responded preferably to the odour while the diurnal Macroglossum stellatarum strongly favoured the visual stimulus. Since a nocturnal lifestyle is ancestral for sphingids, the diurnal species, M. stellatarum, has evolved from nocturnal moths that primarily used olfaction. During bright daylight visual cues may have became more important than odour.},

All plants were grafted onto Rangpur lime (C. limonia) and inoculated with Citrus leprosis virus, cytoplasmic type through the infestation with viruliferous mites, Brevipalpus phoenicis. The experiments were arranged in a completely randomized block design with 10 replicates. Incidence and severity of the disease in leaves and stems as well as plant growth parameters (plant height and stem diameter) were recorded for 3 years after the infestation with the viruliferous mites. The average values of all variables were analyzed using principal component analysis, discriminant factorial analysis, estimation of the clonal repeatability coefficients, and frequency of the distributions of the average values for each measured variable. The principal component analysis resulted in the identification of at least two groups with resistance and susceptibility to leprosis, respectively. About 99\% of all hybrids were correctly classified according to the discriminant factorial analysis. The broad-sense heritability coefficients for characteristics associated with incidence and severity of leprosis ranged from 0.88 to 0.96. The data suggest that the inheritance of resistance to leprosis may be controlled by only a few genes.},

This negative cross-talk may also be exploited by non-vector herbivores which elicit similar anti-herbivore defences in the plant. We studied how damage by the thrips Frankliniella occidentalis and/or infection with Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) affect the performance of a non-vector arthropod: the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae, a parenchym feeder just like F. occidentalis. Juvenile survival of spider mites on plants inoculated with TSWV by thrips was higher than on control and on thrips-damaged plants. However, thrips damage did not reduce spider-mite survival as compared to the control, suggesting that the positive effect of TSWV on spider-mite survival is independent of anti-thrips defence. Developmental and oviposition rates were enhanced on plants inoculated with TSWV by thrips and on plants with thrips damage. Therefore, spider mites benefit from TSWV-infection of pepper plants, but also from the response of plants to thrips damage. We suggest that the positive effects of TSWV on this non-vector species cannot be explained exclusively by cross-talk between anti-herbivore and anti-pathogen plant defences.},

  abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) is a disease associated with the bacteria “Candidatus Liberibacter spp.” and has been devastating citrus orchards around the world. Its management involves control of the insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama. However, the indiscriminate use of chemicals has caused pest outbreaks and eliminated the natural enemies of the vector, such as the parasitoid Tamarixia radiata (Waterston), the main agent for biological control of D. citri. This study assessed the lethal and sublethal effects of insecticides recommended for integrated production of citrus on the parasitoid T. radiata. When adult parasitoids were exposed to residues of 25 insecticides, 20\% of them, i.e., gamma-cyhalothrin, etofenprox, azadirachtin, tebufenozide and pyriproxyfen, were considered as harmless (Class 1), 12\% as slightly harmful (Class 2), 12\% as moderately harmful (Class 3) and 56\% as harmful (Class 4), according to the classification proposed by the IOBC/WPRS. Afterward, 14 insecticides (5 harmless and 9 harmful) were sprayed on the parasitoid pupae. Of the 14 insecticides tested, only the organophosphates dimethoate and chlorpyrifos affected the parasitoid emergence. The effects of insecticides on the parasitism capacity of adults exposed to residues of azadirachtin, etofenprox, gamma-cyhalothrin, pyriproxyfen and tebufenozide (harmless) were also evaluated. Tebufenozide and gamma-cyhalothrin affected the parasitism of the F0 generation, but did not affect the emergence of the F1 and F2 generations. Therefore, for an effective IPM program, selective insecticides or harmful pesticides to adult parasitoids could be used in the field, provided that the adults do not occur naturally and the chemical applications do not coincide with parasitoid releases.},

  abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) or greening is considered the main disease of citrus. This disease is associated with the bacteria “Candidatus Liberibacter spp.”. Once there are no curative measures for the disease, management is based, among other measures, on the control of the insect vector, the Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP) Diaphorina citri. This insect has a host range of about 20 species of the family Rutaceae, including Citrus spp. However, there are a few studies related to their host preference. So, the aim of this project was to evaluate the behavior of the host choice of ACP comparing curry tree (Murraya koenigii) and ‘Valencia’ Sweet orange (Citrus sinensis). Therefore, we have investigated the effect of curry tree volatile on the behavior of D. citri through bioassays with olfactometer type 'Y'. This type of olfactometer is composed of a main pipe and two side glass tubes. Chambers containing the treatments were connected to the tubes. The treatment consisted of citrus plants and curry tree, containing shoots of the same size, and control (clean air). The attractiveness of both males and females, with defined ages, was evaluated. When citrus plants and curry tree were compared, it was observed that the females were more attracted to curry tree than citrus, which did not occur with the males. Subsequent studies will be conducted to collect the possible volatile involved on the process of the host selection of curry tree, looking for the achievement of attractiveness for D. citri management.},

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) Diaphorina citri, vector of ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (CLas), the putative causal agent of citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), is controlled by application of insecticides, which, although effective, has resulted in serious biological imbalances. New management tools are needed, and the technique known as “trap crop” has been attracting attention. A potential plant for use as a trap crop in the management of the ACP is Murraya koenigii (curry leaf). However, for this plant to be used in the field, it needs to be attractive for the vector and must not harbor CLas. To verify the potential of curry leaf as trap crop for the management of HLB, we investigated the ability of D. citri to transmit CLas to M. koenigii, and to other test plants, including M. paniculata (orange jasmine) and cultivar Valencia sweet-orange seedlings. For the tests, the insects were reared on a symptomatic CLas-infected plant and allowed to feed on the three test plant species. The overall maximum transmission rate for the citrus seedlings was 83.3\%, and for orange jasmine was 33.3\%. Successful transmission of CLas by ACP to the curry-leaf seedlings was not observed, and it was treated as immune to CLas. Supported by the previous results that M. koenigii is attractive for ACP, these results indicate that curry leaf is an excellent candidate for use as a trap crop, to improve the management of the insect vector and consequently of HLB.},

Seven nontarget psyllid species representing four psyllid families were exposed to mated D. aligarhensis females in four different treatment types: 1) short sequential no-choice treatments, 2) prolonged sequential no-choice treatments, 3) prolonged no-choice static treatments, and 4) choice treatments. Selection of nontarget psyllid species was based on phylogenetic proximity to D. citri , likelihood of being encountered by D. aligarhensis in the prospective release areas in California, and psyllid species in biological control of invasive weeds. D. aligarhensis exhibited high host affinity to D. citri , and only parasitized one nontarget species, the pestiferous potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc), at low levels (¡14\%). Based on the results of this study, we conclude that D. aligarhensis has a narrow host range and exhibits a high level of host specificity, as it shows a significant attack preference for the target pest, D. citri . Results presented here suggest D. aligarhensis poses minimal risk to nontarget psyllid species in California.},

Contrary to previous claims, P. diaphorinae was found to be an obligate hyperparasitoid and not a primary parasitoid attacking Asian citrus psyllid nymphs. P. diaphorinae was able to successfully reproduce on both Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) and Diaphorencyrtus aligarhensis (Shafee, Alam, and Agarwal) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) pupae, both primary parasitoids of Asian citrus psyllid.

  abstract = {Plants have evolved numerous defensive traits that enable them to resist herbivores. In turn, this resistance has selected for herbivores that can cope with defenses by either avoiding, resisting or suppressing them. Several species of herbivorous mites, such as the spider mites Tetranychus urticae and Tetranychus evansi, were found to maximize their performance by suppressing inducible plant defenses. At first glimpse it seems obvious why such a trait will be favored by natural selection. However, defense suppression appeared to readily backfire since mites that do so also make their host plant more suitable for competitors and their offspring more attractive for natural enemies. This, together with the fact that spider mites are infamous for their ability to resist (plant) toxins directly, justifies the question as to why traits that allow mites to suppress defenses nonetheless seem to be relatively common? We argue that this trait may facilitate generalist herbivores, like T. urticae, to colonize new host species. While specific detoxification mechanisms may, on average, be suitable only on a narrow range of similar hosts, defense suppression may be more broadly effective, provided it operates by targeting conserved plant signaling components. If so, resistance and suppression may be under frequency-dependent selection and be maintained as a polymorphism in generalist mite populations. In that case, the defense suppression trait may be under rapid positive selection in subpopulations that have recently colonized a new host but may erode in relatively isolated populations in which host-specific detoxification mechanisms emerge. Although there is empirical evidence to support these scenarios, it contradicts the observation that several of the mite species found to suppress plant defenses actually are relatively specialized. We argue that in these cases buffering traits may enable such mites to mitigate the negative side effects of suppression in natural communities and thus shield this trait from natural selection.},

The latter two methods were most efficient in detecting onset of adult emergence, seasonal fluctuations in emergence, and population differences among sample dates and among trees. In 1973, further comparisons of the latter two methods gave results similar to 1972 results. The required sample size was influenced by population density. The number of pecan trees to be sampled for a 20\% standard deviation of the mean was small enough to be practical for grower use for most sample dates in 1973 and at dates near peak emergence in 1972.},

  abstract = {Microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) are molecular signatures typical of whole classes of microbes, and their recognition plays a key role in innate immunity. Endogenous elicitors are similarly recognized as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). This review focuses on the diversity of MAMPs/DAMPs and on progress to identify the corresponding pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in plants. The two best-characterized MAMP/PRR pairs, flagellin/FLS2 and EF-Tu/EFR, are discussed in detail and put into a phylogenetic perspective. Both FLS2 and EFR are leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs). Upon treatment with flagellin, FLS2 forms a heteromeric complex with BAK1, an LRR-RK that also acts as coreceptor for the brassinolide receptor BRI1. The importance of MAMP/PRR signaling for plant immunity is highlighted by the finding that plant pathogens use effectors to inhibit PRR complexes or downstream signaling events. Current evidence indicates that MAMPs, DAMPs, and effectors are all perceived as danger signals and induce a stereotypic defense response.},

The spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch is a generalist that can feed on several hundreds of host plant species. Volatiles emitted by T. urticae-infested plants of 11 species were compared: soybean (Glycine max), golden chain (Laburnum anagyroides), black locust (Robinia pseudo-acacia), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), eggplant (Solanum melalonga), thorn apple (Datura stramonium), sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum), hop (Humulus lupulus), grapevine (Vitis vinifera), and ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba). The degree to which the plant species produced novel compounds was analyzed when compared to the odors of mechanically damaged leaves. Almost all of the investigated plant species produced novel compounds that dominated the volatile blend, such as methyl salicylate, terpenes, oximes, and nitriles. Only spider mite-infested eggplant and tobacco emitted a blend that was merely quantitatively different from the blend emitted by mechanically damaged or clean leaves. We hypothesized that plant species with a low degree of direct defense would produce more novel compounds. However, although plant species with a low direct defense level do use indirect defense to defend themselves, they do not always emit novel compounds. Plant species with a high level of direct defense seem to invest in the production of novel compounds. When plant species of the Fabaceae were compared to plant species of the Solanaceae, qualitative differences in spider mite-induced volatile blends seemed to be more prominent in the Fabaceae than in the Solanaceae.},

  abstract = {A detailed account is given of the history, aetiology, biology, epidemiology, detection, geographical distribution, and control of huanglongbing (HLB), a destructive disease of citrus that represents a major threat to the world citrus industry, and is slowly invading new citrusgrowing areas. HLB, whose name in Chinese means "yellow dragon disease", was first reported from southern China in 1919 and is now known to occur in next to 40 different Asian, African, Oceanian, South and North American countries. The agent is a phloem-restricted, non cultured, Gram-negative bacterium causing crippling diseases denoted "greening" in South Africa, "mottle leaf" in the Philippines, "dieback" in India, "vein phloem degeneration" in Indonesia. The HLB bacterium belongs to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter, three species of which are currently known, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, occurring in Asian countries and, to a lesser extent, in Brazil and the USA (Florida), Candidatus Liberibacter africanus with its subspecies "capensis", recorded from African countries, and Candidatus Liberibacter americanus present in Brazil. The suggestion is that each liberibacter species has evolved in the continent after which it is named. HLB symptoms are virtually the same wherever the disease occurs. Infected trees show a blotchy mottle condition of the leaves that results in the development of yellow shoots, the early and very characteristic symptom of the disease. Trees are stunted, declining and bear a few, small-sized, and deformed (lop-sided) fruits, that are poorly coloured (greening) and with coloration starting at the peduncular end (colour inversion). HLB can be transmitted by grafting from citrus to citrus and by dodder to periwinkle. The psyllids Trioza erytreae and Diaphorina citri are natural vectors. Two different types of HLB are known: the heat-sensitive African form transmitted by T. erytreae, which develops at temperatures of 22-25°C, and the heat-tolerant Asian form, transmitted by D. citri, which stands temperatures well above 30°C. Although the HLB pathogen can be identified by electron microscopy, other laboratory methods are used for routine detection. ELISA with monoclonal antibodies is not recommended. Better systems are dot blot hybridization with a DNA probe, and various PCR formats (one-step, nested, multiplex) using species-specific primers based on 16S rRNA or rplKAJL-rpoBC operon sequences. Because no curative methods of HLB are available, control is preventive and largely based on inoculum elimination by removal of infected trees and chemical treatments against vectors. Strict quarantine measures must be implemented to impair further international spread of HLB agents and their vectors.},

  abstract = {Relationships among worldwide collections of Diaphorina citri (Asian citrus psyllid) were analyzed using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) haplotypes from novel primers. Sequences were produced from PCR amplicons of an 821 bp portion of the mtCOI gene using D. citri specific primers, derived from an existing EST library. An alignment was constructed using 612 bps of this fragment and consisted of 212 individuals from 52 collections representing 15 countries. There were a total of eight polymorphic sites that separated the sequences into eight different haplotypes (Dcit-1 through Dcit-8). Phylogenetic network analysis using the statistical parsimony software, TCS, suggests two major haplotype groups with preliminary geographic bias between southwestern Asia (SWA) and southeastern Asia (SEA). The recent (within the last 15 to 25 years) invasion into the New World originated from only the SWA group in the northern hemisphere (USA and Mexico) and from both the SEA and SWA groups in the southern hemisphere (Brazil). In only one case, Reunion Island, did haplotypes from both the SEA and SWA group appear in the same location. In Brazil, both groups were present, but in separate locations. The Dcit-1 SWA haplotype was the most frequently encountered, including *50\% of the countries sampled and 87\% of the total sequences obtained from India, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The second most frequently encountered haplotype, Dcit-2, the basis of the SEA group, represented *50\% of the countries and contained most of the sequences from Southeast Asia and China. Interestingly, only the Caribbean collections (Puerto Rico and Guadeloupe) represented a unique haplotype not found in other countries, indicating no relationship between the USA (Florida) and Caribbean introductions. There is no evidence for cryptic speciation for D. citri based on the COI region included in this study.},

Phylogenetic and molecular analyses reveal that the basic bauplan, UV-blue-green-trichromacy, appears to date back to the Devonian ancestor of all pterygote insects. There are variations on this theme, however. These concern the number of color receptor types, their differential expression across the retina, and their fine tuning along the wavelength scale. In a few cases (but not in many others), these differences can be linked to visual ecology. Other insects have virtually identical sets of color receptors despite strong differences in lifestyle. Instead of the adaptionism that has dominated visual ecology in the past, we propose that chance evolutionary processes, history, and constraints should be considered. In addition to phylogenetic analyses designed to explore these factors, we suggest quantifying variance between individuals and populations and using fitness measurements to test the adaptive value of traits identified in insect color vision systems.},

Simultaneously, chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase activities are induced during the development of A. cladophthirus-induced lesions.

Yellow sticky traps and tapping buds and flowers for thrips are currently recommended for monitoring, but it is not known whether one method is more efficient than the other, or if selectivity could be optimised by trap colour, or addition of semiochemicals ThriplineaÒms or Lurem-TR lures to traps. The number and species of thrips caught by trapping and tapping of flowers and leaves, on different trap colours (black, blue, green, red, yellow, white), including a control (clear) and thrips semiochemicals, were evaluated in a series of trials in commercial deciduous fruit orchards in the Perth Hills, Western Australia. There was poor correlation between thrips caught on traps and tapping samples (R2 ¼ 0.00 e0.05), with tapping less likely to trigger the action threshold and yielding less than 1\% of the number of thrips caught on sticky traps. More thrips (F. occidentalis, T. imaginis and T. tabaci) were caught on blue, yellow and white bases, than on clear, red, green or black bases. On commercially available sticky traps, seven times more F. occidentalis were caught on ‘Seabright blue’ traps than yellow. The addition of semiochemicals increased capture of F. occidentalis by three times on baited compared to unbaited traps, on yellow and ‘Seabright’ blue traps. ThriplineaÒms attracted F. occidentalis, but had no effect on the capture of T. imaginis or T. tabaci, whilst Lurem-TR attracted more F. occidentalis and also increased the capture of T. imaginis. More beneficial insects including brown lacewings (Micromus tasmaniae (Walker)) and hoverflies (Melangyna viridiceps (Macquart)) were caught on blue trap bases (1.6 times more) than other trap base colours. No beneficial insects were present during the ThriplineaÒms experiment, whilst LuremTR increased trap capture of brown lacewings by 1.3 times. A monitoring system incorporating blue sticky traps in conjunction with ThriplineaÒms would be more selective at detecting and monitoring F. occidentalis in deciduous fruit in Australia.},

The Aphalaridae, Liviidae and Psyllidae are redefined, 20 family-group names as well as 28 genus-group names are synonymised, and one replacement name is proposed [Sureaca nomen nov., for Acaerus Loginova, 1976]. Forty two new species combinations are proposed resulting from new genus-group synonymies and a replacement name. One subfamily and three genera are considered taxa incertae sedis, and one genus a nomen dubium. Finally eight unavailable names are listed (one family-group and seven genus-group names).},

  abstract = {Citrus leprosis (CL) was first described in South America in the 1920's. It is considered similar to a disease first observed back to 1860 in Florida. It is a destructive disease characterized by localized lesions on the leaves, fruits and stems, which may lead to the death of the affected plant if left untreated. Around 1940, CL was demonstrated to be transmitted by Brevipalpus mites in Argentina. Because little information exists on the status of CL pathosystem in Argentina and Paraguay, a survey was made in several citrus growing areas of these countries from 2009 to 2011, to evaluate its presence and relevance as well as the identification of the virus and the mite vector. CL was found in most of the sweet orange and/or mandarin orchards in Paraguay (Departamentos de Boquerón, Concepción, San Pedro, Cordillera, Alto Paraná, Itapúa) and Argentina (Provincias de Misiones, Corrientes, Entre Ríos). Incidence was usually low. The causal virus was identified as Citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C) by RT-PCR, electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. In all the visited regions in Paraguay and the region of Montecarlo, Argentina, the mites collected in plants infected by CiLV-C were identified as B. phoenicis. Brevipalpus phoenicis; B. obovatus; CiLV-C},

These mites are obligatory plant feeders, with high host specificity and vagrant (free living) and non-vagrant (part or whole life cycle in a host) lifestyles. The mobility (distance walked - mm, resting time - s, and number of stops) of these mites on host and non-host plant species has been investigated. Eriophyoid species were submitted to walking tests on host and non-host plants using five vagrant species and five non-vagrant species. The walking was recorded with video tracking (ViewPoint) for ten minutes. Twenty replicates were performed for each treatment (eriophyoid species and plant). There was a difference in the behavioral response of the species studied in relation to the hosts. When the species were grouped by ecological lifestyle (vagrant and non-vagrant), non-vagrant eriophyoids presented a higher mobility (higher distance walked, less resting time) than vagrant eriophyoids on their respective hosts. There was no difference in the mobility of vagrant and non-vagrant species on non-host plants. The absence of a pattern of behavioral response among the species tested here indicates that more factors are involved in the host identification and acceptance process}

  abstract = {Invasive species provide powerful in situ experimental systems for studying evolution in response to selective pressures in novel habitats. While research has shown that phenotypic evolution can occur rapidly in nature, few examples exist of genomewide adaptation on short “ecological” timescales. Burmese pythons (Python molurus bivittatus) have become a successful and impactful invasive species in Florida over the last 30 years despite major freeze events that caused high python mortality. We sampled Florida Burmese pythons before and after a major freeze event in 2010 and found evidence for directional selection in genomic regions enriched for genes associated with thermosensation, behaviour and physiology. Several of these genes are linked to regenerative organ growth, an adaptive response that modulates organ size and function with feeding and fasting in pythons. Independent histological and functional genomic data sets provide additional layers of support for a contemporary shift in invasive Burmese python physiology. In the Florida population, a shift towards maintaining an active digestive system may be driven by the fitness benefits of maintaining higher metabolic rates and body temperature during freeze events. Our results suggest that a synergistic interaction between ecological and climatic selection pressures has driven adaptation in Florida Burmese pythons, demonstrating the often-overlooked potential of rapid adaptation to influence the success of invasive species.},

  abstract = {Citrus leprosis is a viral disease vectored by the mites Brevipalpus californicus and Brevipalpus yothersi. This work aimed to determine the potential areas for establishment of both mites and viruses in Mexico, based on the geographical distribution of the hosts and the climatic suitability for the vectors. Life tables of both mites were constructed to determine their thermal requirements—base temperature and degree-days required to complete life cycle—and population growth parameters—net reproduction rate, generation time, and intrinsic growth rate. For this, the mites were confined in Citrus aurantium fruits at 20, 22.5, 25 or 30 °C, 60 ± 5\% RH and L14:D10 h photoperiod. Maps were generated where the climatic suitability for establishment of the mites and the citrus leprosis viruses was estimated in citrus-producing municipalities. The climatic suitability was determined through historical temperature records to calculate the potential number of generations per year, and ecological niche modeling based on collecting localities and bioclimatic variables using the algorithm Maxent. The base temperature was 9.5 °C for B. californicus and 10.2 °C for B. yothersi; degree-days required to reach adulthood were 372.1 and 331.7 °C, respectively. Potential sites for establishment of B. yothersi are mostly lowlands, whereas for B. californicus they are both lowlands and highlands. Temperature data indicate that B. californicus has fewer sites where it can develop ¿ 16 generations per year than B. yothersi. According to our results, the sites where citrus leprosis is most likely to present high incidence are the sweet orange cultivars bordering the Gulf of Mexico.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine whether differences in hairiness of tomato plants affect the functional and numerical response of the predator Neoseiulus californicus McGregor attacking the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. Two tomato hybrids with different density of glandular hairs were used. The functional response was measured by offering eggs and adults of T. urticae at densities ranging from 4 to 64 items per tomato leaflet (surface ca. 6.3 cm2); eggs were offered to predator protonymphs and deutonymphs, adult spider mites to adult predators. The number of spider mites eaten as a function of initial density was fitted to the disc equation. Predator densities were regressed against initial prey densities to analyze the numerical response. The number of eggs and adults of T. urticae eaten by N. californicus was extremely low in both hybrids. The nymphal stage of N. californicus and prey density had a significant effect on the number of T. urticae eggs eaten by the predator, while hybrid had no effect. The functional response fitted reasonably well to the Holling model. The handling time (T h) and the attack rate (a) were very similar among the two hybrids. The numerical response indicated that the absolute density of predators increased with changes in spider mite densities but the relative predator/prey density decreased in both hybrids. Tomato hairiness prevented N. californicus from exhibiting a strong numerical response and the predator functional response was much lower than observed in other host plants and other phytoseiids. This result shows the need to consider plant attributes as an essential and interactive component of biological control practices.},

DNA samples extracted from groups of 2-10 pomelo psyllid nymphs of all stages and from leaves of lemon plants were analyzed with nested-PCR in order to detect ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (Las). The results showed that 24 out of the 49 lemon trees were Las-positive. Also psyllid nymphs collected from 10 out of the 24 Las-positive plants were Las-positive. DNA extracted from individual late stage nymphs (3rd to 5th instars) collected from Las-infected trees were then subjected to nested-PCR trials. Twelve out of the 29 nymphs proved to be Las positive. All nymphs collected from Las-negative lemon trees were also Las-negative. Most psyllid samples which showed positive in nested-PCR were also positive in conventional-PCR detection. The amplified fragment of the 16S rRNA gene of ‘Ca. Liberibacter spp.’ from positive psyllid samples was 99\% similar to those of Las strain psy62 in GenBank. These results demonstrate that Cacopsylla (Psylla) citrisuga is another Las carrier insect. Transmission studies are underway to determine whether Las-positive psyllids can transmit Las to healthy citrus.},

Mass-rearing parasitoids for augmentative biological control has created the need to find storage conditions that will optimize egg load upon release. Food provided to females during the holding period may be foremost among factors that determine the number of eggs available for oviposition following storage. Pairs of newly emerged T. radiata were provided with 8 different diet treatments: water, honey, Nu-Lure® (a proteinaceous liquid made from 44\% hydrolyzed corn gluten meal), host nymphs, honey Nu-Lure, honey host nymphs, Nu-Lure host nymphs, and honey Nu-Lure host nymphs. Female wasps were dissected after 5, 10, 15, and 20 days and mature eggs counted. An average of 4.6 eggs was observed in ovaries of newly emerged females. Honey alone was sufficient for female survival, but egg resorption took place within 5 days after emergence. The combination of honey Nu-Lure resulted in female survivorship similar to a diet of host nymphs, but egg formation was less than with nymphs provided. Tamarixia radiata formed more eggs feeding on mixed diets (Nu-Lure honey nymphs or Nu-Lure nymphs) compared to nymphs alone. However no artificial diet substituted for nymphal hemolymph.},

  abstract = {Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is a modern powerful technique that can be used for studying the external and internal anatomy of arthropods. CLSM has seldom been used in acarology and very rarely for studying eriophyoid mites. It allows the capture of precise digital images of the fine details of external and internal chitinous structures, which can be further analysed using various computer programs. CLSM can serve as an effective tool for comparing closely related and/or cryptic species, correcting diagnoses of poorly described taxa, studying immature instars, and particularly, for studying the structures and the functioning of the internal genitalia of adult females and males. In this paper, the potential use of CLSM for the study of eriophyoids is demonstrated using specimens of 13 mite species and eight genera from the families Phytoptidae Murray 1877 and Eriophyidae Nalepa 1898. This study showed that freshly mounted specimens on microscope slides appeared to be the most appropriate for CLSM as older specimens tended to have reduced autofluorescence. The best choice for studying the external morphology and internal genital apparatus of eriophyoid mites appeared to be the blue laser. Green and light blue wavelengths (488 nm and 532 nm) were found to be less useful. The quality of CLSM images depended on the slide-mounting medium used. Among those compared, Hoyer’s medium was found to be the most appropriate whereas Heinze medium and media including Iodium gave poorer results. The empodia and proximal parts of setae were shown to have very weak autofluorescence signals, but they reflected red (635 nm) and blue (405 nm) laser light, which could be detected with CLSM.}

Resinous irregular areas were present in association with the chlorotic midvein areas of injured cells on the lower leaf surface. Similar injury was occasionally evident on some lateral veins in association with the mites. Yellowed, blistered areas were evident on the upper leaf surface opposite the injured areas on the lower leaf. Leaf drop was evident only on trees that were heavily infested with false spider mites. This type of leaf injury by Brevipalpus mites has not been previously reported on Florida citrus. Chemical control evaluations showed that AC 303,630 in combination with petroleum oil, pyridaben, fenbutatin-oxide, dicofol or high rates of sulfur provided at least 35 days control. Ethion was less effective and carbaryl failed to control these mites.}

  abstract = {For some time, a limited number of species within the superfamily Eriophyoidea have been the only known acari involved in vectoring viruses to plants (Keifer, 1952; Slykhuis, 1963; Walkey, 1991; Oldfield and Proeseler, 1996). More recently, other acarine families have been incriminated as vectors of plant viruses including Brevipalpus species within the Tenuipalpidae and Petrobia latens (Muller) in the Tetranychidae. The spider mite vectors Barley yellow streak mosaic virus (Robertson, 1987; Robertson and Carroll, 1988; Brunt et al., 1996). This is the only documented instance of a spider mite species involved in the transmission of a viral pathogen. Species within the genus Brevipalpus are considered to be the most important economic pests within the family Tenuipalpidae, especially B. californiens (Banks), B. obovatus Donnadieu and B. phoenicis (Geijskes). All three of these species have been incriminated as vectors of at least one unassigned rhabdovirus. The recent establishment of citrus leprosis virus in Panama and its possible spread to other countries within Central America have increased awareness of the potential threat to citrus in North America and elsewhere in the world. Our limited understanding of Brevipalpus mite vectors, their biologies, feeding damage and virus movement within the mite vectors exacerbate the development of effective control strategies for citrus leprosis. These factors and an increasing list of other unassigned rhabdoviruses that are vectored by Brevipalpus mites has led to the preparation of this special issue to provide a concise update on their status. In the opening paper, Childers, French and Rodrigues provide a review of the biology, feeding injury and economic importance of four Brevipalpus species on selected plants of horticultural importance. Extensive color photographs are provided to clearly illustrate the types of feeding injury associated with these mites. The second paper by Childers, Rodrigues and Welbourn reports on the extensive host plant lists of B. califomicus, B. obovatus, and B. phoenicis. Host plants are reported for seven categories that include: each mite species alone, each two species combination of mites, and host plants that are reportedly shared by all three Brevipalpus species. Welbourn, Ochoa, Kane, and Erbe provide a taxonomic review of the genus Brevipalpus with emphasis on B. phoenicis. The taxonomic characters currently used to separate these three species are included and supported with scanning electron micrographs to facilitate character recognition. The extensive host ranges and variation in taxonomic characters within populations of B. californiens and B. phoenicis raise concerns about possible hidden species complexes occurring within these two species. Kitajima, Chagas, and Rodrigues provide a review of Brevipalpustransmitted unassigned rhabdoviruses and virus-like diseases. The unassigned rhabdoviruses are classified as either the cytoplasmic type or the nuclear type of virus. Transmission electron microscopy provides clear examples of both types of viruses. In addition, various associated disease symptoms are provided in both black and white and color plates. Rodrigues, Kitajima, Childers, and Chagas present a review of citrus leprosis virus that is vectored by B. phoenicis on citrus varieties in Brazil. Color plates are provided to clearly illustrate symptomatic differences among various sweet orange varieties on the leaves, twigs and fruit. This is the most serious viral disease vectored by Brevipalpus mites and a color plate shows the cumulative differences between an acaricide-treated sweet orange tree and an untreated sweet orange tree left unprotected against citrus leprosis after only two seasons of growth. Childers, Rodrigues, Derrick, Achor, French, Welbourn, Ochoa, and Kitajima report on the past and present status of citrus leprosis in Florida and Texas. Evidence is provided that strongly suggests that citrus leprosis once occurred in Florida counties and then disappeared. Results of an extensive survey of sweet orange trees across Florida counties that once reported the disease have failed to located disease symptoms during 2001 and 2002. Brevipalpus feeding injuries to both sweet orange and grapefruit in Texas are reported. Citrus leprosis does not result in symptom expression on fruit, leaves or twigs of grapefruit varieties. Chagas, Kitajima, and Rodrigues report on the transmission of coffee ringspot virus by B. phoenicis in Brazil. This disease was not an economic problem initially, however, that changed in recent years with evidence of increasing damage to coffee by the disease. Kondo, Maeda, and Tamada report on orchid fleck virus and its vector, B. californicus and the final paper by Kitajima, Rezende, and Rodrigues provides a review of research conducted on Passion fruit green spot that is vectored by B. phoenicis in Brazil. Some plant feeding insects and mites are effective vectors of plant viruses, in part, because of their high rates of reproduction, dispersal abilities, and obligate use of specific plants as food (Gilbertson et al., 1998). One example is citrus leprosis that is an unassigned rhabdovirus. The virus is not known to exist in citrus within the United States including Hawaii, Europe, South Africa, Australia or different areas within Asia. However, the potential mite vectors in the genus Brevipalpus occur in those countries. Risk for establishment of the virus into one or more of these citrus growing areas must be considered with increasing international movement of people and commodities. In addition, other related and unassigned rhabdoviruses are vectored by Brevipalpus species to coffee, passion fruit, orchids and a wide array of woody ornamentals that are reported in this special issue. The accompanying papers describe the current understanding of the biology, host plants, and distribution of Brevipalpus species as well as their feeding damage and disease symptoms on fruits, leaves and twigs of affected plants.},

  abstract = {According to published reports from 1906 to 1968, leprosis nearly destroyed the Florida citrus industry prior to 1925. This was supported with photographs showing typical leprosis symptoms on citrus leaves, fruit, and twigs. Support for the past occurrence of citrus leprosis in Florida includes: (1) presence of twig lesions in affected orange blocks in addition to lesions on fruits and leaves and corresponding absence of similar lesions on grapefruit; (2) yield reduction and die-back on infected trees; and (3) spread of the disease between 1906 and 1925. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination of tissue samples from leprosis-like injuries to orange and grapefruit leaves from Florida in 1997, and fruits from grapefruit and sweet orange varieties from Texas in 1999 and 2000 did not contain leprosis-like viral particles or viroplasm inclusions. In contrast, leprosis viroplasm inclusions were readily identified by TEM within green non-senescent tissues surrounding leprosis lesions in two of every three orange leaf samples and half of the fruit samples obtained from Piracicaba, Brazil. Symptoms of leprosis were not seen in any of the 24,555 orange trees examined across Florida during 2001 and 2002. The authors conclude that citrus leprosis no longer exists in Florida nor occurs in Texas citrus based on: (1) lack of leprosis symptoms on leaves, fruit, and twigs of sweet orange citrus varieties surveyed in Florida; (2) failure to find virus particles or viroplasm inclusion bodies in suspect samples from both Florida and Texas examined by TEM; (3) absence of documented reports by others on the presence of characteristic leprosis symptoms in Florida; (4) lack of its documented occurrence in dooryard trees or abandoned or minimal pesticide citrus orchard sites in Florida. In view of the serious threat to citrus in the U.S., every effort must be taken to quarantine the importation of both citrus and woody ornamental plants that serve as hosts for Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes), B. californicus (Banks), and B. obovatus Donnadieu (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) from countries where citrus leprosis occurs.},

The primary immune response is referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) and has evolved to recognize common features of microbial pathogens. In the coevolution of host-microbe interactions, pathogens acquired the ability to deliver effector proteins to the plant cell to suppress PTI, allowing pathogen growth and disease. In response to the delivery of pathogen effector proteins, plants acquired surveillance proteins (R proteins) to either directly or indirectly monitor the presence of the pathogen effector proteins. In this review, taking an evolutionary perspective, we highlight important discoveries over the last decade about the plant immune response.},

Our goal was to evaluate the degree to which intraguild predation of A. swirskii by O. insidiosus could affect suppression of F. occidentalis. We conducted laboratory experiments to examine: (1) effects of prey densities, prey composition, and crop structure on predation by O. insidiosus, (2) prey switching by O. insidiosus, and (3) effects of Orius gender on prey preference. If relative densities of F. occidentalis and A. swirskii were varied on flowers or foliage, O. insidiosus always switched to the more abundant prey. Male and female O. insidiosus did not show preference for A. swirskii over immature or adult F. occidentalis, but females killed more prey than males. In greenhouse trials simulating thrips infestations of cut rose crops during commercial production, we compared control of F. occidentalis on roses with releases of only A. swirskii or both O. insidiosus and A. swirskii. Roses with or without predators produced similar numbers of harvestable flowers, but roses without predators had, on average, two to three times more thrips than roses with predators. Concurrent releases of O. insidiosus with A. swirskii did not appear to either interfere with or enhance suppression of F. occidentalis on cut roses because counts of thrips and predatory mites on flowers with both O. insidiosus and A. swirskii were not statistically different from similar counts on flowers with only A. swirskii.}

Three interactions were evaluated under laboratory conditions at 25  C: 1) parasitoid survival if parasitized hosts were exposed to ARSEF 3581 blastospores before or after host mummification; 2) parasitoid survival if mummies containing larva or pupa were exposed to ARSEF 3581 hyphae; 3) parasitoid oviposition on infected hosts with visible or without visible hyphae. Topical application of blastospore formulation onto the dorsal surfaces of live nymphs parasitized with second-instar wasp larva (3 d after parasitism) reduced host mummification by 50\% and parasitoid emergence by 85\%. However, parasitoid emergence was not affected by topical application of blastospore formulation onto mummies that contained fourth-instar wasp larva (6 d after parasitism). Parasitoid emergence was reduced by 80\% if mummies containing fourthinstar wasp larva were covered with blastospore formulation colonized by fungal hyphae. In comparison, parasitoid emergence was not affected if mummies containing wasp pupa (9 d after parasitism) were covered with formulation colonized by fungal hyphae. Female parasitoids oviposited on infected hosts without visible hyphae but not on infected hosts with visible hyphae. Our findings suggest that I. fumosorosea could detrimentally affect T. radiata, if both natural enemies are simultaneously deployed for biological control of D. citri. However, temporal separation of the fungus and parasitoid could reduce antagonism and enhance control of D. citri.},

This study evaluated: 1) lethality of AK devices weathered up to 8 wk on residential citrus; 2) survival of psyllids caged with potted plants and AK devices; 3) psyllid suppression achieved by AK devices on individual dooryard trees. AK devices weathered for up to 8 wk remained lethal to psyllids. Greenhouse trials evaluated survival of adult psyllids caged for 4 d with orange jasmine plants that were: 1) treated with an (beta-cyfluthrin-infused) AK device; 2) treated with a blank (no insecticide) AK device; or 3) ‘untreated’ with no AK device. After 4 d, psyllid survival was on average 95\% lower among adults exposed to plants with AK devices than adults exposed to untreated plants or plants with blank AK devices. Less than half of the adults exposed to plants with AK devices were alive after 1 d and nearly all were dead after 4 d. Deployment of 20 AK devices per tree provided significant psyllid suppression on infested lemon trees from winter to summer and reduced mean reproduction (cumulative eggs) by 91\% and mean attack intensity (cumulative psyllid-days) of adults by 59\% and nymphs by 53\%. AK devices could be an effective control option for D. citri in urban areas.},

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is a serious threat to the U.S. citrus industry because it spreads huanglongbing (HLB), a bacterial and incurable citrus disease. The nymphal parasitoid, Tamarixia radiata Waterston (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), has been extensively released for biological control of D. citri in South Texas since 2010 but provides insufficient control. An ‘attract-and-kill’ (AK) device was evaluated for its compatibility with T. radiata for suppression of D. citri on dooryard citrus. The AK device is visually attractive to D. citri adults because it is the same color as young citrus flush and kills individuals on contact with the toxicant beta-cyfluthrin. This study evaluated 1) lethality of AK devices to T. radiata adults under lab conditions; 2) efficacy of AK devices for year-round psyllid suppression on individual dooryard lemon trees; 3) discovery and parasitism of D. citri colonies by T. radiata on lemon trees with or without AK devices. Contact with AK devices for 5 s or more was lethal to adult parasitoids. Deployment of 20 AK devices per tree provided significant year-round suppression of D. citri on infested lemon trees and reduced mean attack intensity (cumulative psyllid-days) of adults by 66\% and nymphs by 82\%. Discovery and parasitism rates of D. citri colonies by T. radiata were similar on control trees and trees protected by AK devices. An AK device that targets adult psyllids could be used to effectively complement biological control of D. citri by T. radiata in residential landscapes.},

  abstract = {D. citri nymphs suitable for parasitism were available year round in South Texas. • T. radiata parasitism levels depended on the density of D. citri 4th to 5th instars in a colony. • Host density was positively related to parasitoid discovery of psyllid colonies but inversely related to percent parasitism. • Apparent or actual parasitism were equally valid for estimating colony discovery and parasitism levels. • Host-marking or egg limitation could explain why T. radiata parasitism is inversely related to host density. Abstract Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Liviidae) is an invasive citrus pest that colonizes young flush shoots and spreads huanglongbing, a lethal citrus disease. Effects of D. citri colony size (nymphs per shoot) and instar composition on parasitism rates by the nymphal ectoparasitoid, Tamarixia radiata (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), were evaluated on residential citrus in South Texas. From 2016 to 17, D. citri colony sizes and apparent parasitism (T. radiata adult emergence) were monitored monthly on grapefruit, lemon, lime, and orange trees at 12 residential sites. In 2019, size and instar composition of colonies and actual parasitism (mummies and nymphs with parasitoid larvae or eggs) were monitored biweekly on citrus trees at a residential park. Psyllid nymphs were found year-round at these sites with highest densities from late summer to fall and lowest densities in winter. Mean apparent parasitism was independent of citrus species and ranged from 23\% in April 2016 to 4\% in February 2017. Mean actual parasitism ranged from 1.5\% in August to 33.4\% in November 2019. Because actual parasitism of 3rd or younger instars was very rare, a ‘host patch’ was defined as the cluster(s) of 4th to 5th instars within a colony infesting a shoot. Based on apparent or actual parasitism, host density was positively related to discovery of D. citri colonies but inversely related to percent parasitism by T. radiata. The inability of T. radiata to achieve high rates of field parasitism under a wide range of host densities could explain, in part, its low impact against D. citri on residential citrus.}

Las is the pathogen associated with huanglongbing (HLB), the Asian form of which is the most devastating disease of Citrus species and cultivars (Rutaceae: Aurantioideae). M. paniculata is a common ornamental and S. glutinosa is grown as an ornamental, a citrus rootstock, and a hedgerow fence plant. Because of the uncertain status of these plants as reservoirs of Las, a series of cross-inoculation bioassays were carried out in different environments, using infected Valencia sweet orange (Citrus × aurantium) infected shoot tops as a source of inoculum and D. citri nymphs and adults reared on M. paniculata and S. glutinosa to inoculate pathogen-free Valencia orange plantlets. In contrast to sweet orange, Las was more unevenly distributed and reached much lower titers in M. paniculata and S. glutinosa. Infections in M. paniculata and S. glutinosa were also transient. Very few insects that successfully acquired Las from M. paniculata and S. glutinosa were able to transmit the pathogen to healthy citrus. Transmission rates were low from M. paniculata (1.0\%) and S. glutinosa (2.0\%) and occurred only in a controlled environment highly favorable to Las and ACP using 10-day-old adults that completed their life cycle on Las-positive plants. Our study showed that in HLB-endemic areas, M. paniculata and S. glutinosa can be deemed as epidemiologically dead-end hosts for Las and are not important alternative hosts of the pathogen for transmission to citrus. However, under a combination of conditions highly favorable to Las infection and transmission and in the absence of effective quarantine procedures, these plants could eventually serve as carriers of Las to regions currently free from HLB.},

  abstract = {Interpretive Summary: Silverleaf whiteflies feed on host plants by sucking plant juice from leaves. The feeding procedure is complex that involves locating probing sites on leaf surface, stylet penetration, searching for phloem and penetration into it. Using light microscope, electron microscopy and confocal image analysis, we have found the sequence of this feeding behavior. First, whitefly larvae use leaf hair and elongated cells on the leaf surface as a guide to find the location of small veins underneath. Then, larvae secret saliva to produce a sleeve-like sheath that guides the stylets going through mesophyll tissue between cells to reach phloems. If the searching of phloems is not successful, the salivary sheeth is always sealed at the end. It has been known that whiteflies prefer melons than lettuce. Part of the reason is that melons have more small veins than lettuce that help whitefly larvae locate the feeding sites. Technical Abstract: Whitefly feeding biology is complex and includes the location of appropriate sites to probe leaves so that minor veins can be located. Since survival of the nymphal stage of the silverleaf whitefly requires stylet penetration of the smallest veins in host plant leaves, an elaborate series of behavioral acts must be performed for the insect to reach its target. Our studies, using light and electron microscopy as well as confocal imaging, reveal that successful feeding always involves probing of minor veins that contain no more than three xylem elements. We found almost no evidence of stylet or sheath penetration into parenchyma or palisade cells. Sheaths were up to 140 um long and about 2 um in diameter at their widest dimension with the appearance of fused beads. The sheaths were occasionally glued to cell walls and made contiguous contact between the plant leaf surface where penetration originated, proceeding all the way to the veins. Some sheaths terminated blindly without reaching a vascular bundle, and these sheaths were invariably sealed at the end. The relative success of silverleaf whitefly on different species of host plants is, in part, attributable to the geometry of the feeding arrangement in relationship to the availability of minor veins in the host plants. This accounts for the high success of this species on cantaloupe and other cucurbit hosts and the low success on lettuce, the former having more than twice the amount of vascular bundle tissue than the latter.},

  abstract = {Hundreds of billions of insects are produced each year in insectaries or laboratories. These insects are reared for programs of pest control, as feed, for production of various products such as textiles and food, for research and education, among many purposes. The concept is advanced here that rearing conditions are expected to simulate the natural environments from which target insects are derived. Simply speaking, the rearing container and rearing facility are the insect’s microhabitat and its overall environment. Therefore, the central premise of this paper is that rearing systems are human-made ecosystems. If our expectations are to be met, that reared insects are healthy, fit, and of high quality—simulating their wild counterparts, rearing personnel must engineer conditions that meet all the insects’ needs. In this review, major advancements and progress are documented within the context of the ecology involved in artificial rearing technology. In this review, attention is paid to the food, environmental factors (temperature, humidity or water—in the case of aquatic insects—lighting, gas exchange, and soil—for soil-inhabiting insects), containment, and some special features of rearing systems that were designed to meet special needs of a target insect’s biology. Because there are thousands of publications on rearing advancements, the focus is on publications that had the strongest influence on modern day insect rearing systems, as well as papers that represent historically novel rearing concepts. Where the chain of information is missing on how or from where rearing innovations were derived, papers are referenced as documentation of the various rearing system features.},

Plants not only possess direct chemical and morphological defenses against herbivores but also benefit from indirect defenses provided by parasitoids and predators, which use herbivores as hosts or prey. Plants play an active role in the interplay between entomophagous arthropods and herbivores and actually mediate many of the interactions, thereby influencing the intensity of protection received. Herein, we review how plant attributes influence natural enemy efficiency by providing shelter, mediating host/prey accessibility, providing host/prey finding cues, influencing host/prey suitability, mediating host/prey availability, and providing supplemental food sources for natural enemies. In light of this crucial role, we suggest ways of manipulating morphological and chemical attributes of crop plants for a more sustainable and balanced control of insect pests in agro-ecosystems.}

  abstract = {Recognition of pathogen-derived molecules by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is a common feature of both animal and plant innate immune systems. In plants, PRR signalling is initiated at the cell surface by kinase complexes, resulting in the activation of immune responses that ward off microorganisms. However, the activation and amplitude of innate immune responses must be tightly controlled. In this Review, we summarize our knowledge of the early signalling events that follow PRR activation and describe the mechanisms that fine-tune immune signalling to maintain immune homeostasis. We also illustrate the mechanisms used by pathogens to inhibit innate immune signalling and discuss how the innate ability of plant cells to monitor the integrity of key immune components can lead to autoimmune phenotypes following genetic or pathogen-induced perturbations of these components.},

Four species of predatory mites - Amblyseius tamatavensis, Paraphytoseius multidentatus, Typhlodromalus aripo and Typhlodromalus clavicus -, with potential for biological control of pest mites on physic nut culture, and two species of phytophagous mites - Brevipalpus phoenicis and Tarsonemus confusus -, not yet known as pests of the culture were found. Among the evaluated spontaneous weeds, four species - Hyptis suaveolens, Peltaea riedelii, Urochloa mutica and Andropogon gayanus - harbor great richness and abundance of predatory mites, whereas eight harbored a high diversity of phytophagous mites.

D. citri was discovered in southern Florida in 1998 and the HLB disease in 2005. Both have become established throughout citrus-producing areas of Florida. Murraya species are widely grown in southern Florida as ornamental hedges and are readily colonized by D. citri vectors. Colonies of D. citri, isolates of ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ from Taiwan and Florida, and the Murraya species were established in the BSL-3 biosecurity facility at Fort Detrick. In controlled inoculation experiments, D. citri transmitted ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ into M. paniculata (34/36 plants) and M. exotica (22/23 plants), but not into Bergera (Murraya) koenigii. Disease symptoms rarely developed in Murraya plants; however, positive infections were determined by conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Back-inoculations of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ from M. paniculata to Madam Vinous sweet orange resulted in disease development in 25\% of the inoculated plants. Considerable variability was observed in infection rates, titer, and persistence of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ in infected Murraya.},

  abstract = {The citrus leprosis control in São Paulo state is performed exclusively by acaricides to control the vector mite, Brevipalpus phoenicis, which increases the production costs and may affect the beneficial organism's population. Therefore, the aim of this trial was to evaluate during four seasons, the effects of acaricides recommended to control the mite B. phoenicis in conventional and organic citrus over evolution of citrus leprosis and over phytoseiids' population. The experiment was installed in October of 2003 in a citrus orchard in Reginópolis city, state of São Paulo. The experimental design used randomized blocks, the dosages was expressed as mL c.p./ 100 L of water and the treatments were the following: spirodiclofen (20 mL); cyhexatin (50 mL) (used in rotation), lime sulfur (4,000 mL) and control (without pesticide application). However, the rotation between spirodiclofen and cyhexatin began in September 2006. Prior to that time, only spirodiclofen had been used. Surveys were conducted every 15 days on the B. phoenicis, Iphiseioides zuluagai,and Euseius populations. The control level adopted by the B. phoenicis was 8.3\%, and the pesticide applications were conducted using tractor-sprayers. During the 2007-08 seasons, 10 infected fallen fruits per plot were collected and the number of leprosis lesions was quantified by each fruit. By the end of the 2007-08 seasons, the productivity, harvest losses, the disease incidence and severity were evaluated. It was found that the lesions' location over the fruit is more important in determining its drop than the lesions' number. The more intense the mite infestation, the greater is the number of lesions, resulting in increased premature fruit drop. A strategy using acaricides spirodiclofen and cyhexatin in rotation promoted more efficient control of B. phoenicis compared to lime sulfur, resulting in greater productivity, lower fruit losses and severity levels. The lime sulfur applications reduced the mite population incidence below the control level; however it did not prevent the lesions' occurrence. The acaricides applications prevented adverse effects on phytoseiid population because there was a reduction of their density.},

Este trabalho teve como objetivo estudar os aspectos comportamentais reprodutivos de duas espécies de Brevipalpus, em laboratório. As criações de Brevipalpus papayensis Baker e Brevipalpus yothersi Baker foram conduzidas em folhas de Coffea arabica L. Foram estabelecidas colônias para diferentes espécies de Brevipalpus e cada uma foi iniciada com uma única fêmea coletada em diferentes locais. Machos de B. papayensis e de B. yothersi podem proteger uma deutoninfa por um breve período, para se acasalar com ela posteriormente. As fêmeas de B. yothersi ovipositam em aglomerados na nervura central ou colocam alguns ovos isolados ao longo da folha, e, após a postura, recobrem seus ovos com pequenas partículas de substrato. Foi observado na oviposição de B. yothersi e B. papayensis que os ovos formam um ângulo de 30° a 45° em relação à superfície da folha. Em laboratório, as fêmeas de B. yothersi, após a postura, levam em torno de 45 minutos no processo de proteção do ovo com partículas de areia ou gesso.}

  abstract = {The red palm mite, Raoiella indica (Acari: Tenuipalpidae), is a serious pest of coconut plantations in tropical countries such as Brazil. Ecologically-sound control strategies have been sought for this pest; however, the potential of entomopathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) in controlling this pest, as well as its compatibility with co-occurring natural enemies, remains poorly investigated. Thus, the present study was conducted to investigate the potential of four B. bassiana strains in controlling R. indica, as well as the compatibility of the most pathogenic fungal strain with the predatory mites Amblyseius largoensis and Typhlodromus ornatus (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Briefly, the pathogenicity of four B. bassiana strains (Bb-032, Bb-053, Bb-057 and Bb-086), isolated from coconut pests, were tested against R. indica. The B. bassiana strain Bb-032 was selected for further bioassays for being the most pathogenic to R. indica. The red palm mite survival and mean survival time drastically decreased when exposed to B. bassiana strain Bb-032 at both LC50 and LC80. In contrast, neither survival nor mean survival time of A. largoensis and T. ornatus were affected by the exposure to LC50 and LC80 of B. bassiana strain Bb-032. The fungal strain showed considerable selectivity to the two predatory mites; however, at its estimated LC80 for R. indica, reduced oviposition, egg viability and the instantaneous rate of increase (ri) were generally observed for both natural enemies. Therefore, B. bassiana holds potential promise for controlling R. indica in addition to being generally selective to non-target predatory mites.}

  abstract = {We genetically characterized Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) populations from Texas, Florida, and Mexico and the sister taxon Tamarixia triozae (Burks) by two molecular methods. T. radiata is an ectoparasitoid of Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), nymphs. The populations were submitted to intersimple sequence repeat-polymerase chain reaction DNA fingerprinting with two primers. No fixed banding pattern differences were uncovered among the populations of T. radiata with either primer, whereas different patterns were observed in T. triozae, suggesting that there is no genetic differentiation among the populations. Support for these results was obtained by sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region one and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit one (COI) gene. In both genes, the intrapopulational variation range (percentage divergence, \%D) fell within the interpopulational variation range. The \%D at the COI gene between T. radiata and T. triozae was 9.0–10.3\%. However, haplotype structure was uncovered among the populations. No haplotypes were shared between Florida and Texas/Mexico, whereas sharing was observed between Texas and Mexico. Two population-specific nucleotides were identified that allowed the discrimination of the Florida and Texas/ Mexico individuals. A neighbor-joining and a parsimonious tree clustered the populations into two distinct clades. The Florida population clustered into one clade, whereas the Texas/Mexico populations clustered into another clade. The COI phylogeographic analysis suggests that the population of T. radiata in Texas did not come from Florida. The data also suggest that the population in Texas came from Mexico, or vice versa, because the Mexico population showed less haplotype diversity.}

  abstract = {The use of CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized functional genetic work in many organisms, including more and more insect species. However, successful gene editing or genetic transformation has not yet been reported for chelicerates, the second largest group of terrestrial animals. Within this group, some mite and tick species are economically very important for agriculture and human health, and the availability of a gene-editing tool would be a significant advancement for the field. Here, we report on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in the spider mite Tetranychus urticae. The ovary of virgin adult females was injected with a mix of Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting the phytoene desaturase gene. Natural mutants of this laterally transferred gene have previously shown an easy-to-score albino phenotype. Albino sons of injected virgin females were mated with wild-type females, and two independent transformed lines where created and further characterized. Albinism inherited as a recessive monogenic trait. Sequencing of the complete target-gene of both lines revealed two different lesions at expected locations near the PAM site in the target-gene. Both lines did not genetically complement each other in dedicated crosses, nor when crossed to a reference albino strain with a known genetic defect in the same gene. In conclusion, two independent mutagenesis events were induced in the spider mite T. urticae using CRISPR-Cas9, hereby providing proof-of-concept that CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to create gene knockouts in mites.},

This study aimed at evaluating the effect of the vertical volumetric distribution of an axial fan sprayer on the Brevipalpus phoenicis control efficiency. First, an assay was performed to evaluate the vertical volume distribution uniformity of the sprayer, assessing different spray nozzles configurations on the spray arcs, sides of the sprayer and spray heights. Afterwards, another experiment was carried out to analyze the relationship between the distribution of the Fenpyroximate acaricide on Coffea arabica L. and the B. phoenicis control efficiency. The treatments were arranged in a 4 x 2 factorial + 1 additional control, consisting of four spray volumes (200 L ha-1, 400 L ha-1, 600 L ha-1 and 800 L ha-1) and two spray nozzles configurations (1: 100 \% of MAG1.5 nozzles; 2: upper extension with 5 MAG3.0 nozzles, middle extension with 9 MAG1.5 nozzles and lower extension with 4 MAG3.0 nozzles). Configuration 2 provided the smallest coefficient of variation (28 \%). Nozzle configurations had no effect on the incidence of B. phoenicis. The use of nozzles with different flow rates on the spraying arc improves the vertical volumetric distribution uniformity of axial fan sprayers, but does not affect the B. phoenicis control efficiency.

All compounds were previously shown to be active in coupled gas chromatography/electroantennogram experiments. Both the three-component plant attractant blend and 2-phenylethanol were attractive to adult beetles. While male beetles oriented preferentially to both plant attractants vs. a control, females showed little preference. Combining the plant attractants with the pheromone resulted in sexually dimorphic responses similar to those seen with either plant attractant alone. Addition of nonanal abolished the sexually dimorphic response to the pheromone + 2-phenylethanol blend; the new three-component blend was attractive to both sexes. In both laboratory bioassays and field experiments, a combination of the pheromone + the three-component plant attractant was preferred over the plant attractant alone. Thus, it seems likely that combinations of pheromone + plant volatiles may be the most efficacious for field use.},

Not much was known about the biology, geographic origins, or evolutionary history of the genus when R. indica emerged as a major invasive pest. This paper attempts to address some of the basic historical questions regarding the palm mite as well as the genus. Molecular characters from COI and 28S regions were used to produce a phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus in an effort to understand its geographic origin. It also uses COI barcode data to delimit several potentially new species discovered by the authors in Australia. Results show a basal split between R. indica and all other Raoiella species, which indicates Africa or the Middle East as the most probable origin of the genus. Additionally, COI data suggests that at least eight new species are represented among the 20 Australian populations included in this study.},

An aggregation pheromone has been identified for this pest; however, the pheromone is of limited value for population monitoring. To develop more efficient methods to monitor this pest, experiments were conducted to determine whether light functioned as an attractant for the red flour beetle. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of various wavelengths were examined as light sources because they produce bright, narrow light spectra. A comparison of responses to light spectra across the visible and UV regions of the electromagnetic spectrum indicated that the beetle was most attracted to near UV LED at a 390 nm dominant wavelength. The use of LEDs in competitive laboratory experiments resulted in a 20\% capture of released beetles, compared with a 1\% capture with the aggregation pheromone alone.

  abstract = {Diaphorina citri is a major pest of citrus because it transmits Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, a phloem-limited bacterium that putatively causes Huanglongbing (HLB). The disease moves slowly through a tree, and the vector facilitates further within-tree movement via transmission of the pathogen. However, this only happens when D. citri stylets contact the phloem, to inoculate bacteria during phloem salivation and acquire bacteria during phloem sap ingestion. Behavioral changes in D. citri associated with different plant parts would affect how long it takes to reach phloem and how long the psyllids stays in phloem to ingest, thereby influencing the risk of disease spread. D. citri feeding was recorded on the abaxial and adaxial surfaces of mature and immature citrus leaves. Adults in the field can be found on these surfaces at all times of year. On abaxial surface of immature leaves, phloem salivation would occur after 11~h on average, but rarely as soon as 0.56~h. The corresponding values on mature leaves were 16 and 2.7. In general, psyllids spent more time ingesting phloem sap on immature leaves than on mature leaves. Psyllids on abaxial surfaces spent more time ingesting from phloem, though the strength of this effect was less than for immature versus mature leaves. In contrast, xylem ingestion increased on mature leaves compared with young. The biological differences that could produce this outcome are discussed. The results discussed herein are of relevance to further studies on the efficacy of an insecticide to act quickly enough to prevent pathogen transmission.},

Huanglongbing has reduced yields by 68\% relative to pre-disease yields in Florida. Disease management is partly through vector control. Understanding vector biology is essential in this endeavor. Our goal was to document differences in probing behavior linked to sex. Based on both a literature review and our results, we conclude that there is either no effect of sex or that identifying such an effect requires a sample size at least four times larger than standard methodologies. Including both color and sex in statistical models did not improve model performance. Both sex and color are correlated with body size, and body size has not been considered in previous studies on sex in D. citri in terms of probing behavior. An effect of body size was found wherein larger psyllids took longer to reach ingestion behaviors and larger individuals spent more time-ingesting phloem, but these relationships explained little of the variability in these data. We suggest that the effects of sex can be ignored when running EPG experiments on healthy psyllids.},

  abstract = {Recent empirical evidence suggests that many plants respond to herbivore damage by producing inducible defenses. Although several workers have suggested that inducible defenses may be responsible for fluctuations in some herbivore populations, little formal justification for this suggestion exists. We describe here a quantitative framework that may be used for understanding the effects of inducible plant defenses on herbivore populations. In particular, we use procedures for modeling continuous, structured populations to examine the dynamics of interactions between inducible defenses and mobile herbivores. Our models indicate that inducible defenses can by themselves regulate herbivore populations under a wide variety of conditions and that, in conjunction with other regulatory agents (e.g., predators, parasitoids), they can significantly depress herbivore populations. However, only under unusual conditions can inducible defenses cause persistent fluctuations in herbivore populations. Finally, our model suggests that herbivores cannot maintain heterogeneity in the level of inducible defenses within a plant population. These conclusions may not apply to sedentary or selective herbivores or to herbivores with discrete, nonoverlapping generations.},

  abstract = {Temperature influences the life history and metabolic parameters of insects. Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri is a tropical and subtropical pest. ACP invaded new regions around the world and threatened the citrus industry as a vector for Huanglongbing (HLB) disease. ACP is widely distributed and can survive high (up to 45 °C) and low temperatures (as low as − 6 °C). The precise mechanism of temperature tolerance in ACP is poorly understood. We investigated adult survival, cellular energy balance, gene expression, and nucleotide and sugar-nucleotide changes under the effect of different temperature regimes (0 °C to 45 °C with 5 °C intervals). The optimum temperatures for survival were 20 and 25 °C. Low temperatures of 0 °C and 5 °C caused 50\% mortality after 2 and 4 days respectively, while one day at high temperature (40 °C and 45 °C) caused more than 95\% mortality. The lowest quantity of ATP (3.69 ± 1.6 ng/insect) and the maximum ATPase enzyme activities (57.43 ± 7.6 μU/insect) were observed at 25 °C. Correlation between ATP quantities and ATPase activity was negative. Gene expression of hsp 70, V-type proton ATPase catalytic subunit A and ATP synthase α subunit matched these results. Twenty-four nucleotides and sugar-nucleotides were quantified using HPLC in ACP adults maintained at low, high, and optimum temperatures. The nucleotide profiles were different among treatments. The ratios between AMP:ATP and ADP:ATP were significantly decreased and positively correlated to adults survival, whereas the adenylate energy charge was increased in response to low and high temperatures. Exploring energy metabolic regulation in relation with adult survival might help in understanding the physiological basis of how ACP tolerates newly invaded regions.},

  abstract = {In studies of animal colouration it is no longer necessary to rely on subjective assessments of colour and conspicuousness, nor on methods which rely upon human vision. This is important because animals vary greatly in colour vision and colour is context-dependent. New methods make it practical to measure the colour spectrum of pattern elements (patches) of animals and their visual backgrounds for the conditions under which patch spectra reach the conspecific's, predator's or prey's eyes. These methods can be used in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. A patch's colour is dependent not only upon its reflectance spectrum, but also upon the ambient light spectrum, the transmission properties of air or water, and the veiling light spectrum. These factors change with time of day, weather, season and microhabitat, so colours must be measured under the conditions prevalent when colour patterns are normally used. Methods of measuring, classifying and comparing colours are presented, as well as techniques for assessing the conspicuousness of colour patterns as a whole. Some implications of the effect of environmental light and vision are also discussed.},

Twenty-eight arthropod pest species were encountered; the major foliage pests were citrus whiteßy, Dialeurodes citri (Ashmead); purple scale, Lepidosaphes beckii (Newman); Glover scale, L. gloveri (Packard); and citrus red mite, Panonychus citri (McGregor). Two distinct population peaks were recorded for citrus whiteßy at most locations. The most important direct sources of citrus whiteßy mortality were parasitism by Encarsia lahorensis (Howard) and infection by the pathogenic fungus, Aschersonia aleyrodis Webber. In general, all stages of both scale insects (purple scale and Glover scale) were present in the orchards year-round, indicative of overlapping generations; however, the highest densities were recorded during the early season. Citrus whiteßy, purple scale, and Glover scale were more abundant on leaves collected from the interior of the tree canopy than in the exterior canopy. Citrus red mite densities were highest in the spring, with populations declining at the start of the summer, and were more abundant in the exterior canopy than in the interior canopy. The most important natural enemies of citrus red mite were predatory mites belonging to several families, of which Typhlodromalus peregrinus Muma (Phytoseiidae) was the predominant species. Major differences were recorded in the relative abundance of different arthropod pest species in the orchards: citrus whiteßy, purple scale, and Glover scale predominated in the unsprayed orchards, whereas citrus red mite infestations were more severe in the sprayed orchards. The results are discussed in relation to the possible effect of orchard management practices on abundance of the major pests.},

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is the insect vector of huanglongbing (HLB), the most devastating citrus disease in the world. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two species of commercially available predatory mites, Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans) and N. barkeri (Hughes) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), against D. citri. The predatory mites were evaluated by (1) determining their prey stage preference under no-choice conditions by providing eggs, 1ˢᵗ and 2ⁿᵈ instar nymphs; (2) determining the functional and numerical responses of the predators to varying densities of eggs (from 2 to 32/leaf disk); and (3) evaluating the control effect of N. cucumeris on D. citri on caged trees of Citrus reticulata Blanco in the field, using 1 to 8 sachets (900 ± 100 adult mites per sachet) per tree. The results indicated that N. cucumeris consumed eggs of D. citri only, whereas N. barkeri consumed eggs and 1ˢᵗ instar nymphs. Both predators displayed a Type III functional response (sigmoid). A single female adult of N. cucumeris consumed significantly more D. citri eggs than N. barkeri. N. cucumeris could lay eggs when feeding exclusively on D. citri eggs. The field experiment showed that control effect on D. citri was significantly correlated with the number of N. cucumeris released. Two or more sachets released per tree could achieve significant control at an initial density of 30 adult D. citri (male: female = 1:1) per tree. Improvement of field control efficacy of N. cucumeris on D. citri is discussed. El psillido asiático de los cítricos, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), es el insecto vector de huanglongbing (HLB), la enfermedad más devastadora de los cítricos en el mundo. El objetivo de este estudio fue evaluar la eficacia de dos especies de ácaros depredadores disponibles comercialmente, Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans) y N. barkeri (Hughes) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), contra D. citri. Los ácaros depredadores fueron evaluados mediante (1) la determinación de su preferencia por estadios de desarrollo de la presa en condiciones de no selección, al proveer huevos y ninfas de 1er y 2do instar; (2) al determinar las respuestas funcionales y numéricas de los depredadores a densidades variables de huevos (de 2 a 32); y (3) al evaluar el control ejercido por N. cucumeris sobre D. citri en árboles de Citrus reticulata Blanco en jaulas bajo condiciones de campo, liberando 1 a 8 bolsas con ácaros por árbol (900 ± 100 ácaros adultos por bolsa). Los resultados indicaron que N. cucumeris consume solamente huevos de D. citri, mientras que N. barkeri consume huevos y ninfas de 1er instar. Los dos depredadores mostraron una respuesta funcional Tipo III (sigmoide). Las hembras adultas de N. cucumeris mostraron un mayor consumo de huevos de D. citri que N. barkeri. N. cucumeris puede ovipositar cuando se alimenta exclusivamente de huevos de D. citri. El experimento en campo mostró que el nivel de control esta significativamente correlacionado con el número de N. cucumeris liberados. La liberación de dos o más bolsas de ácaros por árbol pueden alcanzar un control significativo cuando la densidad inicial de D. citri es de 30 adultos (macho: hembra = 1: 1) por árbol. El incremento del control de N. cucumeris sobre D. citri en campo es discutido.},

  abstract = {A substantial number of mycoinsecticides and mycoacaricides have been developed worldwide since the 1960s. Here we present an updated, comprehensive list of these products. At least 12 species or subspecies (varieties) of fungi have been employed as active ingredients of mycoinsecticides and mycoacaricides for inundative and inoculative applications, although some are no longer in use. Products based on Beauveria bassiana (33.9\%), Metarhizium anisopliae (33.9\%), Isaria fumosorosea (5.8\%), and B. brongniartii (4.1\%) are the most common among the 171 products presented in this paper. Approximately 75\% of all listed products are currently registered, undergoing registration or commercially available (in some cases without registration), whereas 15\% are no longer available. We were unable to determine the status of the remaining 10\%. Insects in the orders Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Thysanoptera, and Orthoptera comprise most of the targets, distributed among at least 48 families. A total of 28 products are claimed to control acarines (mites and ticks) in at least 4 families, although only three products (all based on Hirsutella thompsonii) were exclusively developed as acaricides. Eleven different technical grade active ingredients or formulation types have been identified, with technical concentrates (fungus-colonized substrates) (26.3\%), wettable powders (20.5\%) and oil dispersions (15.2\%) being most common. Approximately 43\% of all products were developed by South American companies and institutions. Currently, what may be the largest single microbial control program using fungi involves the use of M. anisopliae for control of spittlebugs (Cercopidae) in South American sugarcane and pastures.},

Some oxylipins, most notably those of the jasmonate family, have key roles as potent regulators. Recent advances have been made in understanding oxylipin-regulated signal transduction in response to attack. Much jasmonate signaling takes place via a genetically defined signal network that is linked to the ethylene, auxin, and salicylic acid signal pathways, but a second aspect of jasmonate signaling is emerging. Some jasmonates and several newly discovered cyclopentenone lipids can activate or repress gene expression through the activities of a conserved electrophilic atom group.}

The use of mechanisms which repel or prevent these pests to establish, represent a sustainable environmental technology to reduce the frequency of agrochemical use. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of salicylic acid (SA) on resistance induction against two-spotted spider mite in strawberry cultivars (Aromas and Sweet Charlie). Five concentrations of SA (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg L-1) were tested in order to verify the antixenosis effects. In SA concentration of 50 mg L-1, a reduced number of mites in the two strawberry cultivars was noticed. For the number of eggs deposited on leaflet, we verified an effect of SA concentration with quadratic adjustment in the equation. Sweet Charlie cultivar was more effective than Aromas in relation to the reduction of mite oviposition on leaflets treated with SA. SA concentrations of 25, 50 and 75 mg L-1 were the most efficient for the evaluated traits allowed to infer its potential as antixenotic resistance inducer against two-spotted spider mite in strawberry crop.},

Species related to Citrus occur in Brazilian forests where they may serve as hosts for psyllids and infested citrus orchards. RESULTS The suitability of plants as hosts of D. citri was classified into four groups. Group I (high suitability): Citrus × aurantium ‘Valencia’, ‘Citrus limonia’, Murraya paniculata (syn. Murraya exotica L.) (Aurantioideae: Aurantieae) and Bergera koenigii (Aurantioideae: Clauseneae). Group II (intermediate to low suitability): Citrus (Poncirus) trifoliata ‘Pomeroy’, Citrus wintersii, Swinglea glutinosa (Aurantieae) and Clausena lansium (Clauseneae). Group III (not suitable): Aegle marmelos, Atalantia buxifolia, Citrus (‘Microcitrus’) sp. (Aurantieae) and Helietta apiculata (Amyridoideae). Group IV (non-hosts): Glycosmis pentaphylla (Clauseneae), Balfourodendron riedelianum, Casimiroa edulis, Esenbeckia febrifuga, Esenbeckia leiocarpa, Metrodorea stipularis, Zanthoxylum rhoifolium (Amyridoideae) and Dictyoloma vandellianum (Cneoroideae). Insects survived longer on newly differentiated leaves compared with fully expanded soft leaves. Psyllids either did not develop or did not survive for long on most Group IV species, all of which, with the exception of G. pentaphylla, occur naturally in Brazilian forests. CONCLUSION Citrus relatives occurring in forests near citrus orchards are not suitable hosts of D. citri and, therefore, do not contribute to huanglongbing spread. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

When disease incidence is high, ZC causes large economic losses through reductions in potato yield and tuber quality. No commercial potato variety has been found totally resistant to the pathogen. We evaluated host acceptance behaviors using no-choice assays on three breeding clones derived from Solanum chacoense Bitter with putative tolerance to Lso and/or ZC as part of an effort to determine whether the disease tolerance observed in those breeding clones was related to effects on psyllid settling behavior. We also counted the number of eggs laid and nymphs hatched on the different genotypes to observe any differences in reproduction. The potato variety ‘Russet Burbank’ was used as a susceptible control. Probing frequency and female walking duration were greater on Russet Burbank than the other genotypes. Oviposition did not differ among genotypes. However, female psyllids on two of the Lso-tolerant genotypes displayed reduced fertility 18–24 d after confinement with a male, relative to females on Russet Burbank. These results suggest that although the germplasms display minor abiotic activity on psyllid fertility, tolerance to Lso may be more strongly linked with plant tolerance to the pathogen rather than effects on host acceptance behaviors.},

  abstract = {We describe the first detection of orchid fleck virus (OFV) infecting three unreported hosts: Liriope muscari, cv. ‘Gigantea’ (Decaisne) Bailey, Ophiopogon intermedius Don and Aspidistra elatior Blume (Asparagaceae: Nolinoidaea) in Leon and Alachua Counties, FL. The orchid-infecting subgroup (Orc) of OFV infects over 50 plant species belonging to the plant families Orchidaceae, Asparagaceae (Nolinoidaea), and causes citrus leprosis disease in Citrus (Rutaceae). The only known vectors of OFV-Orc are the flat mites, Brevipalpus californicus (Banks) sensu lato (Trombidiformes: Tenuipalpidae). Florida has various plants in the landscape which Brevipalpus spp. feed on, which are susceptible to infection by OFV-Orc. Chlorotic ringspots and flecking were seen affecting Liriopogons (Liriope and Ophiopogon spp.) in Leon County, FL. Nearby A. elatior also appeared chlorotic. Local diagnostics returned negative for common plant pathogens, therefore new samples were sent to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) and USDA-ARS for identification. Two orchid-infecting strains of OFV were detected via combinations of conventional RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, Sanger sequencing, and high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Amplicons shared 98\% nucleotide identity with OFV-Orc1 and OFV-Orc2 RNA2 genome sequences available in NCBI GenBank. Coinfections were detected in each county, but single strains of OFV-Orc were detected in L. muscari (Alachua, OFV-Orc2) and A. elatior (Leon, OFV-Orc1). Three potential mite vectors were identified via cryo-scanning electron microscopy (Cryo-SEM): B. californicussensu lato, B. obovatus Donnadieu, and B. confusus Baker. In conclusion, OFV orchid strains are present in northern Florida, representing a risk for susceptible plants in the southeastern United States.}

  abstract = {Acaricides that inhibit cellular respiration play an important role in the control of Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes) in citrus groves in Brazil. Studies were conducted to evaluate: (a) the variability in the susceptibility among B. phoenicis populations collected from citrus groves to cyhexatin, azocyclotin, propargite and sulphur; (b) cross-resistance relationships between propargite and azocyclotin, cyhexatin, dinocap, pyridaben and sulphur; and (c) the fitness cost associated with propargite resistance in B. phoenicis under laboratory conditions. A residual-type contact bioassay was used to characterize the susceptibility. The susceptibility was estimated with diagnostic concentrations based LC95 of each acaricide. The cross-resistance was evaluated by characterizing the concentration-mortality responses of susceptible (S) and propargiteresistant (Propargite-R) strains. The fitness cost was evaluated by measuring the biological parameters of S and Propargite-R strains on citrus fruits at 25 ± 1oC and fotophase of 14h. Significant differences in the susceptibility of B. phoenicis were detected at diagnostic concentration of cyhexatin (survivorship from 16.3\% to 80.5\%), azocyclotin (from 3.0\% to 15.0\%), propargite (from 1.0\% a 71.6\%) and sulphur (from 9.0\% to 82.6\%). A low intensity of cross-resistance was detected between propargite and the acaricides azocyclotin (1.8-fold), cyhexatin (4.6-fold), dinocap (3.5-fold) and pyridaben (3.5-fold). On the other hand, the intensity of cross-resistance to sulphur ({$>$} 111-fold) was very high. There was no fitness cost associated with B. phoenicis resistance to propargite, based on biological parameters evaluated. Therefore, the use of these acaricides should also be done very carefully in resistance management of B. phoenicis to acaricides.},

This study evaluates the effect of synthetic MeSA lures (PredaLure) on arthropod populations during the 2009 and 2010 seasons in two Oregon vineyards (Dayton and Salem). MeSA lures were deployed at a low (4/plot or 260 lures/ha) and high (8/plot or 520 lures/ha) rate in \$\textbackslash sim\$152 m2 plots while control plots contained no lure. The predatory mite Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten is considered to be a key biological control agent of the grapevine rust mite, Calepitrimerus vitis Nalepa in Oregon vineyards. Leaf samples were collected to assess T. pyri, C. vitis, spider mite (Tetranychidae) and thrips (Thripidae) population densities in MeSA treated plots compared to control plots. Yellow sticky traps were used to monitor other key predator groups including Anthocoridae, Araneae, Coccinellidae and Syrphidae. Our data did not display consistent trends in T. pyri response to MeSA between treatments at the two field sites over two seasons. Mean seasonal coccinellid counts were significantly higher in MeSA treatments in both years at Dayton. No differences in C. vitis population densities were found between treatments in both years. In 2009 at Salem, significantly lower pest thrips densities occurred in low rate MeSA treatments in the latter part of the season although no trend of decreased seasonal abundance was evident.}

Within the genus Dichorhavirus, CiLV-N is a recently described and distinct species present in Brazil and transmitted by B. phoenicis sensu stricto, whereas the species found in Mexico and Colombia are strains of Orchid fleck virus (OFV-citrus), suspected to be vectored by B. californicus. A study was conducted to determine whether B. californicus and B. yothersi can acquire and inoculate Mexican isolates of CiLV-C and OFV-citrus to sweet and acid citrus species (sweet orange, mandarin, grapefruit, sour orange, Persian lime and Mexican lime) in experiments set up in areas in Mexico with prevalence of the respective viruses. Brevipalpus californicus acquired OFV-citrus and transmitted it to all the citrus cultivars included in the experiment, while B. yothersi acquired CiLV-C and transmitted it only to sweet citrus cultivars (sweet orange, mandarin, and grapefruit). Both mite species were able to become established and reproduce in the experimental plants for nearly a year. This study represents the first experimental evidence of OFV-citrus transmission by B. californicus, as well as evidence that B. yothersi cannot transmit this virus.},

However, other plant species were also found either experimentally or naturally to be susceptible to Citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C). To assess the experimental host range of CiLV-C, a large number of plant species were inoculated with Brevipalpus phoenicis, viruliferous to CiLV-C, under experimental conditions. Out of the 140 tested species (43 families), 59 species (24 families) developed localized chlorotic and/or necrotic lesions upon inoculation of leaves with viruliferous mites, and 40 species (18 families) of them yielded positive results for CiLV-C detection in at least one of the following assays: ELISA, RT-PCR, transmission electron microscopy and immunfluorescence. For those that developed lesions and yielded negative results in CiLV-C detection assays, the results may be attributed to the small number of lesions and their necrotic state with very little viral material. The fact that a considerable number of plant species are susceptible to the virus after mite inoculation brings up implications for the epidemiology, quarantine and evolution of the citrus leprosis pathosystem.

  abstract = {Myllocerus undecimpustulatus undatus Marshall (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), also known as the Sri Lankan weevil, is becoming a major pest of ornamentals and tropical fruit trees in the southern states of United States, especially in Florida. Recent findings of this species in Florida citrus groves justify research into their biology and ecology. Identification of semiochemicals involved in their behavioral and chemical communication will help to develop insect control strategies. We studied morphological and sexually dimorphic characters of this species as an aid to rapid separation of sexes for studies aiming to identify semiochemicals that may be of value in management. Female weevils collected from the field in southeastern Florida were significantly larger than males in length of head, abdomen, and overall length. Females weight was approximately twice that of males. No significant differences in the distance between procoxal or mesocoxal articulations observed between males and females. But the distance between the metacoxal articulations was significantly higher for females than males. All measures of female elytra were significantly greater than those of male elytra. Females, but not males, have a characteristic black–gray marking extending from the ventral mesosternum to the second abdominal segment. Scanning electron microscopic images revealed that females had fewer ovate-to-obovate scales in this region of characteristic black–gray marking and more plumose scales compared with males. Deposition of white cuticular hydrocarbons in this region was less dense on females compared with males. These characters proved sufficient to separate sexes 100\% of the time in a blind test and should allow researchers to develop an accurate gestalt to separate males and females of the Sri Lankan weevil.},

  abstract = {Citrus greening disease (huanglongbing), currently the most destructive citrus disease worldwide, is putatively caused by Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), a phloem-limited bacterium transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri. Electrical penetration graph (EPG) recordings over 42\,h were performed to compare the feeding behavior of D. citri adults and 4th or 5th instar nymphs feeding on CLas-infected or healthy citron plants. Nymphs performed more individual bouts of phloem ingestion (E2) and recorded longer phloem ingestion total time compared with adults, whereas adults performed more bouts of xylem ingestion (G) and recorded greater total time of xylem ingestion compared with nymphs. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction tests indicated that 58\% of nymphs and 6\% of adults acquired CLas during the 42\,h EPG-recorded feeding on infected plants. In a histological study, a greater proportion of salivary sheaths produced by nymphs were branched compared to those of the adults. Our results strongly suggest that more bouts and longer feeding time in the phloem by nymphs may explain their more efficient CLas acquisition from infected plants compared to adults. This is the first EPG study comparing nymphs and adults of D. citri on healthy and infected citrus plants in relation to CLas acquisition.},

  abstract = {Myllocerus undecimpustulatus undatus Marshall (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), also known as the Sri Lankan weevil, is becoming a major pest of ornamentals and tropical fruit trees in the southern USA, including Florida. Recent findings of this species in Florida citrus groves justify research into its biology and ecology. We studied morphological and sexually dimorphic characters of this species as an aid to rapid separation of sexes for studies aiming to identify semiochemicals that may be of value in management. Female weevils collected from the field in southeastern Florida were significantly larger than males in length of head, abdomen, and overall length. Females, but not males, have a characteristic black-gray marking extending from the ventral mesosternum to the second abdominal segment. Scanning electron microscopic images revealed that females had fewer ovateto-obovate scales in this region of characteristic black-gray marking, and more plumose scales compared with males. Host choice and oviposition studies showed that Sri Lankan weevils prefer peach plants over weeds or grasses in peach orchards. Electroantennogram recordings with different peach volatiles identified peach odorants that can elicit significantly higher antennal responses. Both male and female Sri Lankan weevil antennae were highly responsive to these volatiles. Behavioral assays in olfactometers are underway to identify those semiochemicals that could be used as attractants or disruptants. Myllocerus undecimpustulatus undatus Marshall (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), también conocido como el gorgojo (picudo) de Sri Lanka, se está convirtiendo en una plaga importante de ornamentales y árboles frutales tropicales en el sur de los EE. UU., incluyendo la Florida. Los hallazgos recientes de esta especie en los huertos de cítricos de Florida justifican la investigación sobre su biología y ecología. Estudiamos los caracteres morfológicos y sexualmente dimórficos de esta especie como una ayuda para la rápida separación de sexos en estudios que buscan identificar semioquímicos que puedan ser valiosos en el manejo. Los gorgojos recolectados en el campo en el sureste de Florida fueron significativamente más grandes que los machos en cuanto de la longitud de la cabeza, abdomen y cuerpo total. Las hembras, pero no los machos, tienen una marca característica de color negro grisáceo que se extiende desde el mesoesterno ventral hasta el segundo segmento abdominal. Las imágenes de microscopía electrónica de barrido revelaron que las hembras tenían menos escamas de forma ovada a obovada en esta región de esta marca negra gris característica, y más escamas plumosas en comparación con las de los machos. La selección del hospedero y los estudios de oviposición mostraron que los gorgojos de Sri Lanka prefieren las plantas de durazno (melocotón) sobre las malezas o los pastos en los huertos de durazno. Las grabaciones de los electroantenogramas con diferentes sustancias volátiles del durazno identificaron los odorantes del durazno que pueden provocar respuestas antenales significativamente más altas. Las antenas de gorgojo de Sri Lanka, tanto en los machos como en las hembras, fueran altamente sensibles a estos volátiles. Se están realizando ensayos de comportamiento en olfatómetros para identificar aquellos semioquímicos que podrían usarse como atrayentes o perturbadores.},

  abstract = {Citrus volatiles and their breakdown products, such as formic and acetic acids, guide host finding by Asian citrus psyllids (Diaphorina citri). Formic acid elicits psyllid antennal responses and stimulates probing. This study investigated how exposure to vapor phase formic acid induced changes in plant volatile emissions, expression of plant defense genes, and modified psyllid host finding and feeding behaviors on susceptible and resistant citrus cultivars. Chemical analyses of headspace volatiles and behavioral assays were performed before and after exposure of D. citri susceptible and resistant plants to vapor phase formic acid. RT-qPCR elucidated changes in plant defense-associated gene expression following exposure. Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) measured D. citri feeding behavior on citrus with and without exposure to formic acid. Volatilized formic acid caused a 200–500\% increase in release of citrus volatiles 1–3 h after exposure, increased attraction of D. citri to Poncirus trifoliata (resistant) and increased oviposition compared with controls. RT-qPCR showed significant increases in expression of WRKY22, GST1, RAR1, and EDS1 genes following exposure that also reduced phloem, but not xylem, ingestion by adult D. citri. Formic acid exposure caused increased citrus volatile release that modified host finding and feeding behaviors of an important phytopathogen vector.},

  abstract = {Phytophagous insects, including Asian citrus psyllids (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama), use multiple sensory modalities (vision, olfaction, and gustation,) to locate and accept host plants. We explored incorporation of several sensory cues into a multi-modal attract-and-kill device (AK device) using a three-dimensional shape to increase visibility, as well as elements of color, attractant, phagostimulant, UV reflectant, and toxicant. Attraction of adult D. citri to the device was mediated by a combination of a highly reflective yellow cylinder, a UV reflectant compound (magnesium oxide), and an odorant blend as a short-range attractant. The device surface was coated with a slow-release wax matrix (SPLAT™) augmented with a phagostimulant consisting of a 3-component blend (formic acid, acetic acid, and para-cymene) and an insecticide (β-cyfluthrin). Psyllids landing on the device attempted to feed from the wax matrix, became intoxicated, died, and fell from the device. The device remained fully active over a period of 12 weeks partly because dead psyllids or nontargets did not adhere to the surface as occurs on adhesive yellow sticky cards, the industry standard. Laboratory and field assays showed that the device attracted and killed significantly more adult D. citri than ordinary yellow sticky cards. This device or a future iteration based on the design elements of this device is expected to contribute to sustainable and environmentally appropriate management of D. citri by exploiting the psyllid’s innate behavioral responses to visual, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli.},

Suppressing psyllid populations is crucial to prevent disease spread. An attract-and-kill trap based on psyllid behavior would fill a niche for monitoring and control. To optimize visual attraction of psyllids, the ultraviolet (UV) reflective properties of magnesium oxide (MgO) and/or barium sulfate (BaSO4) were assessed for potential application to a trap surface. Under low UV, high UV and natural sunlight conditions, the reflectance, attraction, and probing behaviors of psyllids were evaluated on surfaces containing magnesium oxide or barium sulfate. Magnesium oxide added to yellow sticky traps enhanced visual response of D. citri. Probing assays demonstrated that magnesium oxide alone or as a mixture with a phagostimulant blend, increased the UV reflectance of substrates, as well as, attraction and probing by psyllids. Results demonstrated that psyllids respond to both short (UV) and long (yellow) wavelengths during orientation, and that these inert compounds can increase UV reflectance and improve attractiveness of an attract-and-kill device.},

The interactions of the false spider mites with their host plants and the damage they incur are considered, including the increasing economic importance of Brevipalpus spp. and of Raoiella indica Hirst. The associations of tenuipalpids with plant diseases, caused by bacteria, fungi and especially viruses, are discussed. Methods to reduce tenuipalpid damage are reviewed, including sampling and monitoring in the field, quarantine efforts and horticultural, chemical and biological control means. Lists of natural enemies are appended, and the scarcity of specific natural enemies of the Tenuipalpidae is noted. The postulated modes that these mites employ to elude their predators are discussed. Finally, suggestions for further research are outlined. These include exploration for false spider mites and their natural enemies in relatively little-surveyed regions, studies on the biology of additional pest species and on their toxins, studying the interactions between mites, hosts and plant diseases, and the various modes of sex determination and parthenogenesis in false spider mites, with emphasis on Brevipalpus spp. and their cryptic, possibly host-associated biotypes.}

  abstract = {1. This paper highlights the poor esteem in which taxonomy, as autonomous science, is held and the relative implications of this for conservation biology. 2. In recent times, taxonomy at the species level has tended to be neglected not just within ecological researches, but also in the identification and justification for the selection of the marine protected areas (MPA). A traditional criterion for choosing an MPA is the conservation of biodiversity, but most of the Italian MPA were chosen without initial detailed studies on their biodiversity, so that lists of species of the main invertebrate groups are not available. 3. The identification of organisms within communities to species level is one of the greatest constraints in terms of time and costs in ecological studies. Some studies have suggested that working at a taxonomic level higher than species does not result in an important loss of information (Taxonomic sufficiency). It does, however, lead to an inaccuracy of biodiversity evaluation which is, especially important when comparing different areas, and can lead to an ‘a priori’ exclusion of some entities before understanding their role in ecology. 4. Taxonomy has always been considered a marginal science even during the pioneer descriptive period of ecology, and traditionally has received little financial support. The result was the production of many misidentifications and erroneous records. During recent years, the developing experimental ecological approach has led to an improvement in scientific methods, but concurrently to a reduction in the number of expert taxonomists for many invertebrate groups. Descriptive works, historically so common in the Mediterranean area, are now considered obsolete, despite having an intrinsic value. 5. Biodiversity, particularly ‘species richness’ has long been thought to influence temporal variability and it seems that efforts to clarify the biodiversity/temporal variability relationship or to demonstrate the lack of such a relationship should continue. Such information is essential in order to maintain the ecological function despite the loss of component species, an important topic not only to ecologists but also to policy makers. Many species appear to have overlapping niches, and as such it could be argued that it is not essential for all species to be present. In contrast the crucial role of keystone species has been embraced in conservation biology as a tool to help highlight species requiring priority for protection. 6. Present knowledge of marine systems has led to the conclusion that, before developing theories and experimental design, we need an appropriate description of the system under investigation. A basic knowledge of the general biodiversity in term of species richness of a proposed MPA for example is essential, with a detailed survey providing the taxonomic lists necessary for biotope characterization and a reference data set for future comparisons.},

While nearly all datasets agree on the monophyly of Tetrapulmonata, and modern analyses of molecules and novel morphological and genomic data support Arachnopulmonata (a sister group relationship of Scorpiones to Tetrapulmonata), the relationships of the apulmonate arachnid orders remain largely unresolved. Three threads may allow us to resolve the recalcitrant phylogeny of arachnids: the careful evaluation of large amounts of molecular data; novel techniques grounded in comparative morphology and evolutionary developmental biology, which add improved homology statements and explain the transition between character states; and new fossil discoveries, which continue to incorporate relevant novel data to the discussion of the relationships among the arachnid orders.},

  abstract = {Carnivorous arthropods exhibit complex intraspecific and interspecific behaviour among themselves when they share the same niche or habitat and food resources. They should simultaneously search for adequate food for themselves and their offspring and in the meantime avoid becoming food for other organisms. This behaviour is of great ecological interest in conditions of low prey availability. We examined by means of an olfactometer, how volatile chemicals from prey patches with conspecific or heterospecific predators might contribute to shaping the structure of predator guilds. To test this, we used the exotic predatory mites Typhlodromalus manihoti and T. aripo, and the native predatory mite Euseius fustis, with Mononychellus tanajoa as the common prey species for the three predatory mite species. We used as odour sources M. tanajoa-infested cassava leaves or apices with or without predators. T. manihoti avoided patches inhabited by the heterospecifics T. aripo and E. fustis or by conspecifics when tested against a patch without predators. Similarly, both T. aripo and E. fustis females avoided patches with con- or heterospecifics when tested against a patch without predators. When one patch contained T. aripo and the other T. manihoti, females of the latter preferred the patch with T. aripo. Thus, T. manihoti is able to discriminate between odours from patches with con- and heterospecifics. Our results show that the three predatory mite species are able to assess prey patch profitability using volatiles. Under natural conditions, particularly when their food sources are scarce, the three predatory mite species might be involved in interspecific and/or intraspecific interactions that can substantially affect population dynamics of the predators and their prey.},

  abstract = {Herbivorous spider mites occurring on tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cope with plant defences in various manners: the invasive Tetranychus evansi reduces defences below constitutive levels, whereas several strains of T. urticae induce such defences and others suppress them. In the Mediterranean region, these two species co-occur on tomato plants with T. ludeni, another closely related spider mite species. Unravelling how this third mite species affects plant defences is thus fundamental to understanding the outcome of herbivore interactions in this system. To test the effect of T. ludeni on tomato plant defences, we measured (1) the activity of proteinase inhibitors, indicating the induction of plant defences, in those plants, and (2) mite performance on plants previously infested with each mite species. We show that the performance of T. evansi and T. ludeni on plants previously infested with T. ludeni or T. evansi was better than on clean plants, indicating that these two mite species down-regulate plant defences. We also show that plants attacked by these mite species had lower activity of proteinase inhibitors than clean plants, whereas herbivory by T. urticae increased the activity of these proteins and resulted in reduced spider mite performance. This study thus shows that the property of down-regulation of plant defences below constitutive levels also occurs in T. ludeni.},

  abstract = {Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is a key pest of citrus associated with the yet uncurable Huanglongbing (HLB) disease, that is threatening worldwide citrus production. Control of D. citri has hitherto relied on chemical insecticides and on the use of the parasitoid Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). However, use of insecticides is problematic due to environmental and social issues, especially where D. citri is mostly spread in residential areas, and use of T. radiata has resulted in mixed success. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find sustainable and complementary practices to control this pest. Generalist predators, including green lacewings and coccinellids, have been frequently associated to D. citri in field surveys, yet they have rarely been tested. We have tested the predation capability under laboratory, greenhouse and semi-field conditions, of five predators: the green lacewings Chrysoperla comanche (Banks) and C. rufilabris Burmeister (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), the coccinellids Diomus pumilio Weise and Rhyzobius lophanthae (Blaisdell) (Cole­ optera: Coccinellidae) and the brown lacewing Sympherobius barberi Banks (Neuroptera: Hemerobiidae). All of them were capable of feeding on D. citri and reduce its populations under laboratory conditions, but critical differences emerged in greenhouse and field cages, with some predators (the green lacewings and D. pumilio) being the most effective. We discuss possible ways of utilizing these predators as an additional biological control tool to address current limitations of D. citri control in commercial groves, in residential areas and at the urbanagricultural interface.},

The current study investigated the biology and determined the fertility life table of T. radiata in different temperatures, to obtain information to support the establishment of a biological control program for D. citri in Brazil. Fifth-instar nymphs of D. citri were offered to females of T. radiata for parasitism, for 24 h. Then, the parasitoid was removed and the nymphs were placed in incubators at 15, 20, 25, 30, or 35 ± 1°C, 70 ± 10\% RH, and a 14-h photophase. The percentages of parasitism and emergence, the sex ratio, and the preimaginal period of T. radiata were determined. The fertility life table was developed from the biological data. The highest parasitism rate (77.24\%) was obtained at a temperature of 26.3°C, and the lowest parasitism rates occurred at 15 and 35°C (23.1 and 40.2\%, respectively). The highest percentages of emergence of the parasitoid occurred at 25, 30, and 35°C (86.7, 88.3, and 78.8\%, respectively), with the calculated peak at 30.8°C (89.90\%). The duration of the preimaginal developmental period for both females and males of T. radiata was inversely proportional to temperature in the thermal range of 15–35°C. The development of T. radiata occurred at all temperatures studied, and the highest viability of the preimaginal period occurred at 25°C. The highest values of net reproductive rate and finite growth ratio (λ) were observed at 25°C, so that in each generation the population of T. radiata increased 126.79 times, higher than the values obtained at the other temperatures.},

Tamarixia radiata is the main agent for the biological control of Diaphorina citri in Brazil with a parasitism rate ranging from 20 to 80\%. This study investigated the influence of temperature on the development, fecundity and longevity of adults of T. radiata and the effect of relative humidity (RH) on their parasitism capacity and survival rate in the pre-imaginal period. The effect of temperature was assessed in the range between 15 and 35 ± 1oC, 70 ± 10\% RH, and a 14-h photophase. The RH effect was evaluated in the range from 30 to 90 ± 10\%, temperature at 25 ± 1oC, and photophase of 14-h. At 25oC, circa 166.7 nymphs were parasitized, the highest parasitism capacity observed compared to other treatments. The longest longevity of females was observed at 25oC, although the rate did not differ in the 20-30oC temperature range. The threshold temperature (TT) was 7.2oC, and 188.7 degrees-day were required for the development (egg-to-adult period). The parasitism rate and longevity were higher at 50 and 70\% of RH. This shows that temperature and RH may affect the parasitism capacity of T. radiata on nymphs of D. citri, which can explain the great parasitism variation for D. citri observed in citrus groves in Sao Paulo State, Brazil.},

I hypothesize that many invasive non-indigenous species do alter these properties at several scales. The non-indigenous plant species in Florida considered the most invasive by the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council are examined for this capability through review of the available literature. Out of 31 species total, 12–20 (39–64\%) potentially alter the ecosystem properties of geomorphology, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and disturbance. When population-level properties that indicate superior competitive ability of the invading species are examined, 13–24 (42–77\%) of the species are included, with the majority of species showing traits capable of modifying natural systems at both ecosystem and community/population scales. This review suggests that ecosystem alteration may be relatively common among invasive non-indigenous species. However, much of the current information is anecdotal. Empirical studies directly examining the effects of species on ecosystem and smaller-scale processes are necessary, and highly invasive species may be particularly appropriate for such research. Further, as non-indigenous species homogenize the global flora, they may also homogenize the local flora by increasing the representation of ruderal species. Where ecosystem processes have been altered, site restoration likely will require both control of the invader(s) and recovery of processes.},

While N. glutinosa is very susceptible to Cercospora nicotianae, Chalara elegans and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae, the hybrid is as resistant as N. debneyi to these fungi. The resistance of the hybrid is linked to high levels of chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, peroxidase (PO) and polyphenoloxidase (PPO). The parental species contain much lower levels of these enzymes unless they are locally infected with necrotizing viruses. In those cases, chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase and PO, but not PPO, increase in the whole plant to levels comparable with those found in the hybrid, and resistance to secondary infection develops (systemic acquired resistance). All the acidic isoenzymes of PO present in both parental species after infection are constitutively expressed in the hybrid. The activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was similar in all plants. These results reinforce the hypothesis that hydrolases and PO are involved in resistance against various pathogens.}

Several studies on this and other flower-visiting insects have shown how olfactory and visual stimulation play (or do not play) a role in attraction and feeding. Nevertheless, these studies have consistently manipulated stimuli in a`presence–absence' manner. Here, we experimentally decoupled the presentation of both stimuli spatially and temporally in a wind tunnel, rather than entirely eliminating either one, and found that the decision-making process based on these stimuli is more flexible and complex than previously asserted. Manduca sexta was most responsive when both cues were present and emanated from the same source. When stimuli were spatially separated, responsiveness levels were comparable to those elicited by a single stimulus. However, transient olfactory stimulation either before or after visually guided approach (temporal decoupling) enhanced responsiveness to an odorless visual target. Additionally, searching times were increased by either a transient olfactory stimulation before take-off or by having the flower model spatially separated from the odor source tracked by the moths. Finally,in a dual-choice experiment, moths showed a strong bias for the visual display over the odor plume, suggesting the former to be the ultimate indicator of a nectar source. Our manipulation of floral cues shows that the feeding behavior of M. sexta, and probably of other nectivorous insects, is based not only on the sensory stimulation per se but also on the temporal and spatial pattern in which these stimuli are perceived.},

All commercially cultivated citrus is susceptible and varieties tolerant to disease expression are not yet available. Onset of disease occurs following a long latent period after inoculation, and thus the pathogen can spread widely prior to detection. Detection of the pathogen in Brazil in 2004 and Florida in 2005 catalyzed a significant increase in research on D. citri biology. Chemical control is the primary management strategy currently employed, but recently documented decreases in susceptibility of D. citri to several insecticides illustrate the need for more sustainable tools. Herein, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of D. citri biology and behavior, pathogen transmission biology, biological control, and chemical control with respect to “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus.” Our goal is to point toward integrated and biologically relevant management of this pathosystem.},

In Florida, Asian citrus psyllid was well established by the time of HLB discovery and growers did not remove trees to eliminate inoculum, so there was no chance of controlling the epidemic. Based on the Florida experience, Texas proactively controlled the vector by implementing area-wide management and disease spread was slower than in Florida, however, they also did not remove infected trees. California controlled both ACP and tree inoculum and have delayed the development of an epidemic in the Central Valley. This situation is aided by topographic isolation from the Los Angeles basin where ACP and HLB are endemic and a climate distinctly different from other citrus growing regions in the U.S.},

  abstract = {Invertebrates are among the most diverse organisms on Earth, significantly contribute to ecosystem function and integrity, and possess high potential as bioindicators. By definition, invertebrates also are wildlife. Yet, inclusion of invertebrates in peer-reviewed wildlife journals has not been investigated. As such, our objective was to assess inclusion of invertebrates in prominent wildlife journals published in the last decade. Based on our review and first-hand experience, we also aimed to provide recommendations for integration of invertebrates into wildlife science, education, and peer-reviewed literature. We performed a systematic literature review by manually searching all issues and articles from 2003–2013 of the following journals: European Journal of Wildlife Research, Journal of Wildlife Management, South African Journal of Wildlife Research, Wildlife Biology, Wildlife Research, and Wildlife Society Bulletin. We analyzed data derived from our review to elucidate trends in the inclusion of invertebrates in these journals. We identified 4,916 articles that involved animal taxa, of which 122 (2.5\%) included invertebrates and 1\% included invertebrates as focal taxa. Our results indicated invertebrates are included in a minute portion of articles in top wildlife journals. We recommend a paradigm shift to a less taxonomically homogenized and vertebrate-centric approach to wildlife science and education, integrating invertebrates into wildlife studies, and publishing results of those studies in wildlife journals to facilitate effective management of all wildlife species. \textbackslash copyright 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {Because asexual species lack recombination, they have little opportunity to produce genetically variable offspring and cannot adapt to changes in their environment. However, a number of asexual species are very successful and appear to contradict this general view. One such species is the phytophagous mite Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes), a species that is found in a wide range of environments. There are two general explanations for this pattern, the General Purpose Genotype (GPG) and Frozen Niche Variation (FNV). According to the GPG model, an asexual species consists of clones that can all survive and reproduce in all the different niches. Alternatively, the FNV model postulates that different clones are specialized to different niches. We have performed a test to distinguish between these models in B. phoenicis. Mites from three populations from three different host plant species (citrus, hibiscus and acerola) were transplanted to their own and the two alternative host plants and mite survival and egg production were measured. Additionally, the mite populations were genotyped using microsatellites. Fitness was seriously reduced when mites were transplanted to the alternative host plant species, except when the alternative host was acerola. We concluded that B. phoenicis clones are specialized to different niches and thus the FNV best describes the broad ecological niche of this species but that there is also some evidence for host plant generalization. This conclusion was strengthened by the observations that on each host plant species the native mite population performed better than the introduced ones, and that three microsatellite markers showed that the mite populations are genetically distinct.},

  abstract = {Bacterial symbionts that manipulate the reproduction of their host to increase their own transmission are widespread. Most of these bacteria are Wolbachia, but recently a new bacterium, named Cardinium, was discovered that is capable of the same manipulations. In the host species Brevipalpus phoenicis (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) this bacterium induces thelytoky by feminizing unfertilized haploid eggs. The related species B. obovatus and B. californicus are thelytokous too, suggesting that they reproduce in the same remarkable way as B. phoenicis. Here we investigated the mode of thelytokous reproduction in these three species. Isofemale lines were created of all three species and 19 lines were selected based on variation in mitochondrial COI sequences. All B. phoenicis and B. californicus lines (10 and 4 lines, respectively) produced males under laboratory conditions up to 6.7\%. In contrast, males were absent from all B. obovatus lines (5 lines). Additional experiments with two B. phoenicis isofemale lines showed that males can be produced by very young females only, while older females produce daughters exclusively. For most lines it was shown that they are indeed feminized by a bacterium as treatment with antibiotics resulted in increased numbers of males up to 13.5\%. Amplification and identification of specific gyrB sequences confirmed that those lines were infected with Cardinium. Three out of the five B. obovatus lines did not produce males after treatments with antibiotics, nor did they contain Cardinium or any other bacterium that might induce thelytoky. In these lines thelytoky is probably a genetic property of the mite itself. Despite the different causes of thelytoky, flow cytometry revealed that all 19 lines were haploid. Finally, the taxonomic inferences based on the mitochondrial COI sequences were incongruent with the classical taxonomy based on morphology, suggesting that a taxonomic revision of this group is necessary.},

The different approaches used have included a functional study of the activity of the receptor His kinase, the determination of the ethylene receptor signaling complex at the endoplasmic reticulum and of the regulation of CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1) activity by these receptors, the identification of a unique MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE (MAPK) cascade, the cloning and characterization of numerous ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/EIN3-like (EIL) transcription factors from many plant species, and the integration of the ethylene and jasmonate response pathways via the ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) family of transcription factors. The elucidation of the biochemical mechanisms of ethylene signal transduction and the identification of new components in the ethylene response pathway in Arabidopsis are providing a framework for understanding how all plants sense and respond to ethylene.}

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, was discovered in Florida in 1998. It can be one of the most serious pests of citrus if the pathogens that cause citrus greening disease (huanglongbing) are present. Citrus greening recently has been reported in Brazil by Fundecitrus, Brazil. The establishment of D. citri in Florida increases the possibility that the disease may become established. Diaphorina citri can be separated from about 13 other species of psyllids reported on citrus. The biology of D. citri makes it ideally suited to the Florida climate. Only two species, D. citri and Trioza erytreae (del Guercio), have been implicated in spread of citrus greening, a disease caused by highly fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria. The disease is characterized by blotchy mottle on the leaves, and misshapen, poorly colored off-tasting fruit. In areas where the disease is endemic, citrus trees may live for only 5-8 years and never bear usable fruit. The disease occurs throughout much of Asia and Africa south of the Sahara Desert, on several small islands in the Indian Ocean, and in the Saudi Arabian Peninsula. Transmission of citrus greening occurs primarily via infective citrus psyllids and grafting. It is transmissible experimentally through dodder and might be transmitted by seed from infected plants and transovarially in psyllid vectors. Citrus greening disease is restricted to Citrus and close citrus relatives because of the narrow host range of the psyllid vectors. Management of citrus greening disease is difficult and requires an integrated approach including use of clean stock, elimination of inoculum via voluntary and regulatory means, use of pesticides to control psyllid vectors in the citrus crop, and biological control of psyllid vectors in non-crop reservoirs. There is no place in the world where citrus greening disease occurs that it is under completely successful management. Eradication of citrus greening disease may be possible if it is detected early. Research is needed on rapid and robust diagnosis, disease epidemiology, and psyllid vector control.},

The evidence for their defensive function originates mainly from laboratory studies with trained parasitoids and predators; the defensive function of these emissions for plants in natural settings has been rarely demonstrated. In native populations and laboratory Y-tube choice experiments with transgenic Nicotiana attenuata plants unable to release particular volatiles, we demonstrate that predatory bugs use terpenoids and green leaf volatiles (GLVs) to locate their prey on herbivore-attacked plants. By attracting predators with volatile signals, this native plant reduces its herbivore load – demonstrating the defensive function of herbivore-induced volatile emissions. However, plants producing GLVs are also damaged more by flea beetles. The implications of these conflicting ecological effects for the evolution of induced volatile emissions and for the development of sustainable agricultural practices are discussed.},

Weekly trapping was conducted in young and mature trees with traps deployed directly in trees, one trap per tree. In addition, a comparison was made between one and three traps per tree in the mature trees. Solar radiation was positively correlated with numbers of adults trapped per week in both groups of trees. Air temperature was positively correlated with captures of adults in the mature trees. The value of traps as indicators of absolute densities of adults was therefore reduced by changes in sunlight and temperature. Captures of adults were not reduced by rain. A positive correlation was found for data from the young trees between trap captures of adults and maximum daily wind speed. SigniÞcant correlations were found between numbers of adults on leaves and traps. However, little conÞdence could be placed on individual predictions of adult densities on leaves based on numbers of adults on traps. Increasing the number of traps per tree from one to three did not improve individual estimates, although detection of adults in trees was improved using three traps when adult population levels were low. A better quantitative relationship between adults on traps and leaves might have been determined if greater sample sizes had been used to estimate densities. Regardless, day-to-day differences in sunlight and air temperature will inßuence numbers of adults captured on traps, thus reducing the value of traps as indicators of absolute densities.},

Addition of the food coloring was necessary to prompt adults to feed. Among the feeding trials discussed, a mean of 69.1 ± 3.2\% adults survived for 14 d on the base sucrose diet. Survival rates of males and females were similar. Adults feeding on the sucrose diet may have ingested less food than adults feeding on citrus leaf disks based on differences in quantities of adult excrements deposited in feeding chambers. However, survival of adults feeding on leaf disks over a 2-wk period was only marginally better than survival of adults feeding on the base sucrose diet, and final rates of survival of adults fed these two food sources were not significantly different.},

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, is an important pest in Florida because it transmits bacteria responsible for citrus huanglongbing disease. In addition to infesting citrus, orange jasmine ( Murraya exotica L.) is one of Asian citrus psyllid’s preferred host plants and is widely grown as an ornamental hedge. We report on Asian citrus psyllid bionomics over three years at five urban plantings of orange jasmine and on biological control of Asian citrus psyllid by a parasitoid Tamarixia radiata (Waterston). T. radiata had been released in Florida shortly after Asian citrus psyllid was first found, and the parasitoid was known to be established at each planting. Additionally, three new T. radiata haplotypes were released every 3 wk at three plantings during the first study year (one haplotype per planting, over all releases an average of 17 parasitoids per linear meter of hedge); all three haplotypes were released at a fourth planting beginning midway through the study (over all releases, an average combined total of 202 parasitoids per linear meter of hedge). Asian citrus psyllid populations were present year-round at each planting, often at large levels. Such plantings may pose risk to commercial citrus as Asian citrus psyllid reservoirs. Releases of the new haplotypes did not cause any measurable reduction in Asian citrus psyllid population levels during the study, and ironically percentage parasitism was generally highest at a planting where no releases were made. Higher release rates might have been more effective. The probability is discussed that repetitive pruning of orange jasmine reduced the full potential of T. radiata against Asian citrus psyllid in this study.},

  abstract = {Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama) transmits a bacterium ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (CLas) putatively responsible for a devastating citrus disease known as Asiatic huanglongbing (HLB) (citrus greening disease). The psyllid and disease have invaded many citrus-growing regions including the United States, where the disease is seriously jeopardizing the Florida citrus industry. We recently concluded research that showed CLas transmission rates are increased when citrus flush is present. Flush is any new leaf growth ranging in development from first emergence up until the leaves are fully expanded yet still tender. In an experiment with seedlings of a rootstock cultivar ‘US-942’, a 1-wk infestation of 20 Asian citrus psyllids from an infected colony resulted in 53–60\% of seedlings becoming infected when flush was present compared with only 7\% when no flush was present. In a second experiment with ‘US-942’, 77–97\% of seedlings became infected when flush was present compared with 40\% when no flush was present. A similar experiment with ‘Valencia’ sweet orange resulted in 23, 80, and 3\% seedlings becoming infected when young, older, or no flush was present, respectively. Young plants are therefore more likely to contract HLB if flush is present, with older flush promoting higher infection rates under the conditions of this study. Based on this finding, healthy citrus should be protected from Asian citrus psyllid infestations throughout a flush. To evaluate germplasm for CLas resistance, inoculations using infected Asian citrus psyllid would best be achieved if flush is present.},

(Rhizobiales: Rhizobiaceae) (CLas) transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae)). Plant resistance to CLas holds promise as a strategy for reducing the economic impact of HLB; thus, citrus breeders are developing new varieties and cultivars and evaluating these for resistance/tolerance to CLas. A high-throughput inoculation program was established to expedite testing of germplasm. Colonies of Asian citrus psyllid maintained on CLas-infected plants are used for the inoculations. The primary inoculation step is to cage a healthy citrus seedling with new leaf growth for a 2-wk inoculation feeding period by 20 adult Asian citrus psyllids (no regard to sex or age) from these colonies. The adults are removed after the inoculation period, and the plants are then treated with a pesticide to eliminate any adults missed or infestation of immatures.The objective here was to evaluate inoculation rates under this procedure. Ten sets of 20 healthy citrus seedlings were subjected to the procedure, one set a month, and the percentage of seedlings successfully inoculated based on testing by quantitative polymerase chain reaction were determined 6 mo after each 2-wk inoculation period. The results indicated a 77\% mean transmission rate (percent infected seedlings), with rates ranging from 40 to 100\%. Transmission rates were positively correlated with the percentage of Asian citrus psyllid that tested positive for CLas but not correlated with titers of CLas in these psyllids. Possible reasons for variability in transmission rates are discussed.},

  abstract = {Citrus yields have declined by almost 56\% since Huanglongbing (HLB) was first found in Florida (2005). That reduction forced citrus growers to replant trees at much higher densities to counter-balance tree loss. The current project aims to determine how much water is required to grow citrus trees at higher planting densities without reducing their productivity. The study was initiated in November 2017 on eight-month-old sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) trees grafted on the ‘US-897′ (Cleopatra mandarin × Flying Dragon trifoliate orange) citrus rootstock planted in the University of Florida, Southwest Florida Research and Education Center (SWFREC) demonstration grove, in Immokalee, FL (lat. 26.42° N, long. 81.42° W). The soil in the grove is Immokalee fine sand (Sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Arenic Alaquods). The demonstration grove included three densities on two rows of beds (447, 598, and 745 trees per ha) replicated four times each and three densities of three rows of beds (512, 717, 897 trees per ha) replicated six times. Each density treatment was irrigated at one of two irrigation rates (62\% or 100\%) during the first 15 months (2017–2019) then adjusted (2019–2020) to represent 26.5, 40.5, 53, and 81\% based on recommended young citrus trees evapotranspiration (ETc). Tree growth measurements including trunk diameter, height, canopy volume, leaf area, and root development were evaluated. During the first year, reducing the irrigation rate from 100\% to 62\% ETc did not significantly reduce the young citrus tree growth. Conversely, the lower irrigation rate (62\% ETc) had increased citrus tree’s leaf area, canopy volume and tree heights, root lifespan, and root length by 4, 9, 1, 2, and 24\% compared with the higher irrigation rate (100\%), respectively. Furthermore, the root lifespan was promoted by increasing planting density. For instance, the average root lifespan increased by 12\% when planting density increased from 447 to 897 trees per ha, indicating that planting young trees much closer to each other enhanced the root’s longevity. However, when treatments were adjusted from April 2019 through June 2020, results changed. Increasing the irrigation rate from 26.5\% to 81\% ETc significantly enhanced the young citrus tree growth by increasing citrus tree’s canopy volume (four fold), tree heights (29\%), root lifespan (86\%), and root length (two fold), respectively. Thus, the application of 81\% ETc irrigation rate in commercial citrus groves is more efficient for trees from two to four years of age.},

Pecan weevil emergence from the soil was observed from 1974–78 near Hamilton, TX, and was found to occur at about the same time and rate from year to year when soil moisture was adequate to impart sufficient friability to allow adults to emerge. Pecan weevil emergence from other locations in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Georgia (estimated primarily from the literature) appears to be similar in pattern to that observed at Hamilton, and a comparison indicated that when the influence of soil moisture on emergence was taken into account the time and rate of emergence was strikingly similar regardless of location.},

Two distinct viruses are associated with this disease, one that produces particles primarily in the nucleus of infected plant cells (Citrus leprosis virus nuclear type [CiLV-N]; Dichorhavirus) and another type that produces particles in the cytoplasm of infected plant cells (Citrus leprosis virus cytoplasmic type [CiLV-C]; Cilevirus). Both forms are transmitted by Brevipalpid mites and have bipartite, single-stranded, RNA genomes. CiLV-C and CiLV-N are present in South and Central America and as far north as parts of Mexico. Although leprosis disease was originally described from Florida, it disappeared from there in the 1960s. The United States Department of Agriculture–Agricultural Research Service maintains preserved citrus specimens identified at inspection stations 50 or more years ago with symptoms of citrus leprosis. We isolated RNA from these samples and performed degradome sequencing. We obtained nearly full-length genome sequences of both a typical CiLV-C isolate intercepted from Argentina in 1967 and a distinct CiLV-N isolate obtained in Florida in 1948. The latter is a novel form of CiLV-N, not known to exist anywhere in the world today. We have also documented the previously unreported presence of CiLV-N in Mexico in the mid-20\textbackslash textsuperscriptth century.},

  abstract = {Vision is considered to be an important component of the sensory system used by herbivorous insects to locate host plants. We investigated preferences for transmissive colors and contrasts in the apple blossom weevil, Anthonomus pomorum L., which colonizes apple trees, Malus domestica Borkh., in early spring. The main components of the supposed visual system, green, blue, and UV light, were offered to the weevils versus black or versus each other in a dual choice arena. Furthermore, silhouettes of two different achromatic contrasts were offered in front of the colors blue and green. We also tested whether visual preferences change with time, i.e., 2, 4, and 6 d after termination of diapause in early spring. Female weevils chose UV, green, and blue over black, whereas males only chose UV over black in a series of dual choice experiments. Both sexes preferred blue to green. Weevil response to silhouettes of different contrasts was influenced by the background color, i.e., the silhouette with the higher contrast was preferred in front of green, whereas the silhouette with the lower contrast was preferred in front of blue. The preferences during visual orientation did not change with time after diapause. The more discriminating response of females may reflect a greater visual acuity or a greater visual responsiveness in females than in males because of a higher affinity for the host plant. Our findings indicate that weevils might have a trichromatic visual system and that they are able to include visual cues for the location of host plants in the field.},

Combined tactics of pest management have special significance not only for a reduction in pesticide residues but also to maintain the natural enemy activity, which is an objective of IPM programs. Here, we investigated the effect of low-lethal concentrations of bifenazate at LC10, LC20, and LC30 on development and reproduction parameters of Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Lethal and sub-lethal concentrations were estimated using leaf dip bioassay method. The crude data were analyzed based on age-stage, two-sex life table analysis. Toxicological assays showed bifenazate treatments gradually decreased the longevity and total life span of both sexes. Our results indicated that reproductive and total fecundity of the next generation were also affected by sublethal concentrations. All concentrations caused a significant decline in oviposition days, compared to the control. The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) varied from 0.1344 to 0.1151 day-1 for the mites treated with distilled water and LC30 treatments, respectively. The finite rate of increase (λ) was affected by the Acaricide concentration (lowest at LC30 concentration: 1.1221 day-1). Bifenazate concentration (LC10, LC20 and LC30) treatments gradually reduced the gross reproduction rate (GRR) and net reproductive rate (R0). Based on obtained results from current study, bifenazate is not a favorable Acaricide with A. swiriskii and cannot be recommended to use with this predatory mite in integrated management.}

  abstract = {In ecology, a hypothesis is usually not discarded if a few studies reject it, as long as there are other studies supporting it. How to assess the usefulness of ecological hypotheses is therefore not straightforward. Using the enemy release hypothesis as an example, we show how creating a hierarchy of hypotheses (HoH) can help reviewing and evaluating evidence for and against an ecological hypothesis. In a HoH, a broad, overarching hypothesis branches into more specific and better testable sub-hypotheses. The enemy release hypothesis is a major hypothesis in invasion ecology and posits that the absence of enemies in the exotic range of an alien species is a cause of its invasion success. Based on a systematic review of empirical tests of this hypothesis, we divided it into sub-hypotheses, differentiating among 1) indicators for enemy release, 2) types of comparisons, and 3) types of enemies. We identified 176 empirical tests and weighted each test according to the number of alien species studied and the research method (experimental vs observational, field vs enclosure vs laboratory). For the broadly formulated enemy release hypothesis, we found nearly as much supporting (36\%) as questioning evidence (43\%). At the sub-hypotheses level, however, we found that some sub-hypotheses are strongly supported by empirical evidence, whereas others receive hardly any support. These differences are further emphasized for some types of habitat and focal taxonomic groups. Our findings suggest that several specific formulations (i.e. sub-hypotheses) of the broad enemy release hypothesis are useful, whereas other formulations should be viewed more critically. In general, the approach outlined here can help evaluate major ecological hypotheses and their specific sub-hypotheses. Our study also highlights the need for a scientific debate on how much supporting evidence is sufficient to consider an ecological hypothesis to be useful.},

Such analyses could inform both effective resource allocation and management planning. We evaluated long-term invasive plant management expenditures and their potential geographic, economic, and ecological drivers for freshwater and terrestrial conservation areas in Florida, USA. Average expenditures for managing invaders were approximately US\$45M annually, with over 90\% of funding provided by the state. Our model showed that expenditures were best predicted by the prevalence of waterways and abundance of invaders, indicating that funding was allocated towards asset protection in highly invaded aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Higher spending was directly correlated with reduced area invaded for the costliest invader (Hydrilla verticillata, \$10M/year), demonstrating management efficacy and constructive use of resources. Our study highlights that significant funding is required to manage plant invaders in Florida and that greater funding would likely limit the extent of invasions. Additional analyses of management cost-effectiveness for Florida and other regions would benefit from consistent collection and reporting of high-resolution management data. Given the exponential rate of spread of many invaders, additional and sustained management funding is needed for early detection and rapid, effective control of invasive species.},

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), transmits the citrus greening pathogen ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (CLas) by feeding on citrus phloem sap. Because phloem sap is rich in sugars but low in amino acids, ACP sucks large quantities and excretes most of it as honeydew. We studied the chemical composition of ACP honeydew on various host plants. Honeydew samples were analyzed with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Fourteen sugars, 13 amino acids, and six organic acids were detected in the honeydew of ACP. Sugars composed about 95\% of the total compounds. Sucrose and trehalose were the predominant sugars, composing about 58 and 23\% of the total sugars, respectively. Proline, asparagine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid were the most abundant amino acids in ACP honeydew. The host plant and its infection with CLas had some effect on the honeydew composition. Glucose, chiro-inositol, myo-inositol, inositol, maltose, and turanose were lower in honeydew collected from CLas-infected citrus compared to that collected from non-infected trees. In CLas-infected citrus (pineapple sweet orange, Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) and Bergera koenigii (L.) Spreng. [curry leaf tree (both Rutaceae)] honeydews, valine, alanine, serine, glutamine, glycine, and the organic acids were lower than in honeydew from healthy citrus. Mannose, galactose, inositol, mannitol, an unknown disaccharide, and proline were higher in the honeydew collected from B. koenigii than in honeydew collected from healthy citrus (pineapple sweet orange), whereas fructose, chiro-inositol, myo-inositol, trehalose, and lactic acid were lower. The findings of this study help us understand the metabolism and the nutrient needs of ACP that transmits CLas, the pathogen of huanglongbing in citrus.},

Seven nontarget psyllid species (Þve native and two selfintroduced species) representing Þve families were exposed to T. radiata under the following three different exposure scenarios: 1) sequential no-choice tests, 2) static no-choice tests, and 3) choice tests. Nontarget species were selected for testing based on the following criteria: 1) taxonomic relatedness to the target, D. citri; 2) native psyllids inhabiting native host plants related to citrus that could release volatiles attractive to T. radiata; 3) native psyllids with a high probability of occurrence in native vegetation surrounding commercial citrus groves that could be encountered by T. radiata emigrating from D. citri-infested citrus orchards; 4) a common native pest psyllid species; and 5) a beneÞcial psyllid attacking a noxious weed. The results of host range testing were unambiguous; T. radiata exhibited a narrow host range and high host speciÞcity, with just one species of nontarget psyllid, the abundant native pest Bactericera cockerelli Sulc, being parasitized at low levels (Ͻ5\%). These results suggest that the likelihood of signiÞcant nontarget impacts is low, and the establishment of T. radiata in southern California for the classical biological control of D. citri poses negligible environmental risk.},

Rather than acting as passive victims in these interactions, plants respond to herbivory with the production of toxins and defensive proteins that target physiological processes in the insect. Herbivore-challenged plants also emit volatiles that attract insect predators and bolster resistance to future threats. This highly dynamic form of immunity is initiated by the recognition of insect oral secretions and signals from injured plant cells. These initial cues are transmitted within the plant by signal transduction pathways that include calcium ion fluxes, phosphorylation cascades, and, in particular, the jasmonate pathway, which plays a central and conserved role in promoting resistance to a broad spectrum of insects. A detailed understanding of plant immunity to arthropod herbivores will provide new insights into basic mechanisms of chemical communication and plant-animal coevolution and may also facilitate new approaches to crop protection and improvement.},

  abstract = {The Chinese box orange (Severinia buxifolia) was shown by graft-inoculation and psyllid-transmission tests to be an alternative host of the bacterium causing citrus Huanglongbing (HLB). A PCR-based assay for detection of the HLB bacterium (HLBB) was used to monitor HLBB. In graft-inoculation tests, the Chinese box orange (CBO) grafted with HLBB-infected scions of Luchen sweet orange (LSO) were positive for HLBB, 2–3 months after grafting. The back-grafting test demonstrated that HLBB-infected CBO scions could transmit HLBB back to LSO hosts via grafting. In psyllid-transmission tests, psyllids (insect vectors) transmitted HLBB to CBO plants, in which HLBB could be detected 3–4 months after inoculation. Acquisition-access tests of psyllids revealed that HLBB-free psyllids can acquire HLBB from diseased CBO hosts and can transmit HLBB back to the LSO plants. A field survey verified the presence of HLBB-infected CBO plants in the vicinity of citrus orchards. In this paper, CBO is shown to be a susceptible host plant in which HLBB can exist and replicate. It is also a donor plant from which HLBB can be transmitted to citrus hosts by grafting or by psyllid vectors.},

  abstract = {The western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, is an important pest of maize (Zea mays L.). Published WCR diets contain corn root powder, which is not available for purchase, thereby limiting the practical use of diets containing this ingredient. We applied response surface modeling combined with mixture designs to formulate a WCR diet that does not require corn root powder. We developed the new formulation by systematically exploring eight protein ingredients from animal, plant, and yeast sources based on simultaneous evaluation of three life history parameters (weight, molting, and survival). This formulation (WCRMO-2) without corn root powder supported approximately 97\% of larval survival and successful molting. Larval weight gain after 10 days of feeding on WCRMO-2 was 4-fold greater than that of larvae feeding on the current best published WCR diet. Additionally, there was no significant difference in these larval performance traits when larvae were reared on WCRMO-2 and the best proprietary WCR diet. A commercial version of WCRMO-2 was tested and found to perform comparably for these traits. These improvements met our goal of a diet comprised of available ingredients that supports performance of WCR larvae equal to or better than publicly available formulations and proprietary formulations.},

  abstract = {Background Plant immunity against pathogens and pests is comprised of complex mechanisms orchestrated by signaling pathways regulated by plant hormones [Salicylic acid (SA) and Jasmonic acid (JA)]. Investigations of plant immune response to phytopathogens and phloem-feeders have revealed that SA plays a critical role in reprogramming of the activity and/or localization of transcriptional regulators via post-translational modifications. We explored the contributing effects of herbivory by a phytopathogen vector [Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri] and pathogen [Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas)] infection on response of sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] using manipulative treatments designed to mimic the types of infestations/infections that citrus growers experience when cultivating citrus in the face of Huanglongbing (HLB) disease. Results A one-time (7 days) inoculation access period with CaLas-infected vectors caused SA-associated upregulation of PR-1, stimulating defense response after a long period of infection without herbivory (270 and 360 days). In contrast, while repeated (monthly) ‘pulses’ of 7 day feeding injury by psyllids stimulated immunity in CaLas-infected citrus by increasing SA in leaves initially (up to 120 days), long-term (270 and 360 days) repeated herbivory caused SA to decrease coincident with upregulation of genes associated with SA metabolism (BMST and DMR6). Similarly, transcriptional responses and metabolite (SA and its analytes) accumulation in citrus leaves exposed to a continuously reproducing population of D. citri exhibited a transitory upregulation of genes associated with SA signaling at 120 days and a posterior downregulation after long-term psyllid (adults and nymphs) feeding (270 and 360 days). Conclusions Herbivory played an important role in regulation of SA accumulation in mature leaves of C. sinensis, whether or not those trees were coincidentally infected with CaLas. Our results indicate that prevention of feeding injury inflicted by D. citri from the tritrophic interaction may allow citrus plants to better cope with the consequences of CaLas infection, highlighting the importance of vector suppression as a component of managing this cosmopolitan disease.}

  abstract = {In the northern distribution areas of the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri in Japan, psyllid population densities in citrus groves were much lower than on Murraya paniculata hedges. We investigated the preference of D. citri adults for M. paniculata and Citrus unshiu to interpret such different occurrences. When D. citri adults were released into a screen house containing potted M. paniculata and C. unshiu, the number of adults on both plants increased until the 4th day after release. Thereafter, the mean densities remained relatively constant for 18 days on each plant species before the start of new adult emergence. On most M. paniculata trees, new shoots were always produced by late December, and adult densities increased after the increase of new shoots and declined one or two months after the peak density. New shoots of C. unshiu available for D. citri reproduction were produced only once on two trees, on which adult densities become abundant after the growth of new shoots and decreased gradually until late December. On the other four C. unshiu trees, adults migrated from other trees and their densities remained relatively constant. When D. citri adults were introduced into a preference test chamber containing buds and leaves of C. unshiu and M. paniculata, the adults were significantly more aggregated on the buds than on the leaves of both plants. No preference between C. unshiu and M. paniculata for either buds or leaves was detected. The present experimental results suggested that the difference in the population levels of D. citri on C. unshiu and M. paniculata in their northern distribution areas was not caused by the preference of the insect, but may be due to continuous production of new shoots and dense planting of M. paniculata hedges favoring the reproduction and survival of D. citri during the typhoon season and winter.},

The effects of four species of potted flowering native California plants, potted flowering buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) and Euphorbia marginata (both non-native), honeydew from D. citri and Coccus hesperidum, cut flowers from lemon and orange trees, 50\% honey-water, and water only on the longevity, survivorship and reproduction of T. radiata was investigated in the laboratory. Fecundity was measured by counting egg load of parasitoid cohorts ∼15 h of age at time of set up and those that were removed for dissection from test arenas at 1, 6, and 18 days after introduction, or at time of death. Maximum survival of female T. radiata was 34 days on honey-water. Survival on honey-water, buckwheat and C. hesperidum honeydew was statistically equivalent, and these three food treatments significantly enhanced parasitoid survival when compared with all remaining food treatments. Female T. radiata fed on D. citri honeydew survived an average of 5 days, which was 3 days longer, on average, than those provided with water only. Parasitoid egg load significantly decreased with increasing days alive, thereby demonstrating the synovigenic nature of T. radiata. Parasitoids that fed on buckwheat flowers and died from natural causes had, on average, 5 more mature eggs in their ovaries at time of death when compared to parasitoids that died when provided access to other experimental sugar sources that were tested. These results suggest that buckwheat may be a useful insectary plant in citrus orchards that could enhance the efficacy of T. radiata against D. citri.},

Trapping was conducted in March through May of 2013 and 2014 when psyllid populations usually are highest.

Based on increasing knowledge of the biochemistry and genetics of major pest insects, weeds and agricultural pathogens, the search for selectivity has become an ever more important part of pesticide development and can be achieved by appropriate structural modifications of the active ingredient. Propesticides affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion parameters, which can lead to biological superiority of these modified active ingredients over their non-derivatised analogues. Various selected commercial propesticides testify to the successful utilisation of this concept in the design of agrochemicals.

  abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) is a systemic disease of citrus caused by phloem-limited bacteria ‘Candidatus Liberibacter’ spp. with ‘Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus’ (Las) the most widespread. Phloem-limited bacteria such as liberibacters and phytoplasmas are emerging as major pathogens of woody and herbaceous plants. Little is known about their systemic movement within a plant and the disease process in these tissues. Las movement after initial infection was monitored in leaves and roots of greenhouse trees. Root density, storage starch content, and vascular system anatomy in relation to Las presence in field and greenhouse trees, both with and without symptoms, showed the importance of root infection in disease development. Las preferentially colonized roots before leaves, where it multiplied and quickly invaded leaves when new foliar flush became a sink tissue for phloem flow. This led to the discovery that roots were damaged by root infection prior to development of visible foliar symptoms and was not associated with carbohydrate starvation caused by phloem-plugging as previously hypothesized. The role of root infection in systemic insect-vectored bacterial pathogens has been underestimated. These findings demonstrate the significance of early root infection to tree health and suggest a model for phloem-limited bacterial movement from the initial insect feeding site to the roots where it replicates, damages the host root system, and then spreads to the rest of the canopy during subsequent leaf flushes. This model provides a framework for testing movement of phloem-limited bacteria to gain greater understanding of how these pathogens cause disease and spread.},

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, is the most economically important and difficult to manage citrus pest in Florida due to its role as vector of huanglongbing or citrus greening disease. Spread of the disease is a function of dispersal patterns and thus influenced by availability of suitable hosts. Young leaves of citrus or related plants are required for reproduction, but in their absence, secondary hosts may provide needed resources to enhance survival. Therefore, survivorship on and preference for three abundant weed species was investigated. The suitability of potential secondary host plants Bidens alba (L.), DC, Ludwigia octovalvis (Jacqu.) P. H. Raven, and Eupatorium capillifolium (Lam.) Small was compared to a reproductive host, Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack, in no‐choice tests by assessing survivorship of D. citri adults confined to these plants in cages. Preference was evaluated by choice tests where D. citri adults were released into cages containing all three secondary hosts alone or with M. paniculata. Both B. alba and E. capillifolium increased D. citri survivorship by twofold compared to starvation conditions with only water available. Choice trials revealed no difference in initial selection between true and secondary hosts; however, the true host was favoured over time. This result suggested that hosts were selected initially by sight, and only later by taste and/or smell. While secondary hosts are unable to support reproduction or long‐term survival, these findings establish the ability of D. citri to use secondary hosts that are ubiquitous in Florida citrus groves as temporary reservoirs for food and moisture when ideal host conditions are scarce or absent.},

  abstract = {The Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) is a serious pest of citrus in many citrus-producing regions. It vectors the bacterium ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ thought to be the causal agent of the devastating “Huanglongbing” (HLB) or citrus greening disease. Both pest and the disease are well established in Florida. Several insect predators, particularly lady beetles and the parasitoid Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), are known to cause significant mortality to ACP immatures. However, there are no reports on the effectiveness of predatory mites against ACP. We evaluated the suitability of D. citri eggs and nymphs as prey for the predatory mite Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae) in laboratory arenas, and its potential to reduce psyllid populations in the glasshouse on caged Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack plants. Mortality of D. citri eggs on M. paniculata shoots exposed to A. swirskii in plastic arenas was 4 times greater after 6 d compared to unexposed control plants. Mites were also observed sucking out body fluids of first instar nymphs. In the glasshouse, total number of D. citri adults collected over 8 wk from infested plants in ventilated cylinders with A. swirskii present averaged 80\% less than the control without mites. These findings showed a significant negative impact of A. swirskii on D. citri under controlled conditions. Further research needs to focus on rates and frequency of release, impact of A. swirskii on D. citri populations in citrus and other hosts under field conditions, and interactions of A. swirskii and D. citri with native predatory mites.},

We measured recovery of predators on lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus L.) that were infested with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. Factors thought to affect movement and colonization were distance to a receiver unit from a release (landing) point, intervening soil surfaces such as clods, gravel, fine soil and grass, and management of soil surfaces such as mulching, watering or both. In the field, the effect of distance (0.11–1.76\textbackslash hspace0.167emm) from a landing point to a receiver unit was significant, with a negative log-linear relationship. Soil surfaces such as clods and management actions such as watering with mulching allowed for more capture of predators on bean plants with prey than did other treatments. Environmental conditions greatly affected survival of N. fallacis.Predators in the field that were present on bare soil suffered high mortality (ca. 90\%) at fluctuating daytime conditions of 26.4\textbackslash hspace0.167em\$\textbackslash pm\$\textbackslash hspace0.167em4.8\textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$}C and 56\textbackslash hspace0.167em\$\textbackslash pm\$\textbackslash hspace0.167em13.4\% RH.

One of the most important management methods is the control of D. citri with pesticides, but their intensive use causes development of resistance and pollution. An alternative method is therefore necessary to manage this vector-pathogen system. The generalist predatory mite Amblyseius herbicolus Chant (Acari: Phytoseiidae) can be found on citrus and orange jasmine plants, important hosts of D. citri in Brazil. Here we show that this phytoseiid can reproduce and develop on D. citri eggs. The predation rate was higher on D. citri eggs collected from plants in the field than on eggs from small plants from a laboratory rearing. Yet the predator preferred eggs from the laboratory. This may indicate that the higher predation rate of eggs from the field served to compensate for these eggs being of lower nutritional quality. This was confirmed with a series of experiments with limited numbers of eggs. We conclude that Amblyseius herbicolus is a potential biological control agent of D. citri, and its performance and control may be affected by the quality of the host plant.},

Owing to its frequency-dependent character, the arms race hypothesis predicts that herbivores exhibit genetic variation for traits that determine how they deal with the defences of a given host plant phenotype. Here, we show the existence of distinct variation within a single herbivore species, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, in traits that lead to resistance or susceptibility to jasmonate (JA)-dependent defences of a host plant but also in traits responsible for induction or repression of JA defences. We characterized three distinct lines of T. urticae that differentially induced JA-related defence genes and metabolites while feeding on tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). These lines were also differently affected by induced JA defences. The first line, which induced JA-dependent tomato defences, was susceptible to those defences; the second line also induced JA defences but was resistant to them; and the third, although susceptible to JA defences, repressed induction. We hypothesize that such intraspecific variation is common among herbivores living in environments with a diversity of plants that impose diverse selection pressure.},

  abstract = {Plants are hotbeds for parasites such as arthropod herbivores, which acquire nutrients and energy from their hosts in order to grow and reproduce. Hence plants are selected to evolve resistance, which in turn selects for herbivores that can cope with this resistance. To preserve their fitness when attacked by herbivores, plants can employ complex strategies that include reallocation of resources and the production of defensive metabolites and structures. Plant defences can be either prefabricated or be produced only upon attack. Those that are ready-made are referred to as constitutive defences. Some constitutive defences are operational at any time while others require activation. Defences produced only when herbivores are present are referred to as induced defences. These can be established via de novo biosynthesis of defensive substances or via modifications of prefabricated substances and consequently these are active only when needed. Inducibility of defence may serve to save energy and to prevent self-intoxication but also implies that there is a delay in these defences becoming operational. Induced defences can be characterized by alterations in plant morphology and molecular chemistry and are associated with a decrease in herbivore performance. These alterations are set in motion by signals generated by herbivores. Finally, a subset of induced metabolites are released into the air as volatiles and function as a beacon for foraging natural enemies searching for prey, and this is referred to as induced indirect defence. Scope The objective of this review is to evaluate (1) which strategies plants have evolved to cope with herbivores and (2) which traits herbivores have evolved that enable them to counter these defences. The primary focus is on the induction and suppression of plant defences and the review outlines how the palette of traits that determine induction/suppression of, and resistance/susceptibility of herbivores to, plant defences can give rise to exploitative competition and facilitation within ecological communities “inhabiting” a plant. Conclusions Herbivores have evolved diverse strategies, which are not mutually exclusive, to decrease the negative effects of plant defences in order to maximize the conversion of plant material into offspring. Numerous adaptations have been found in herbivores, enabling them to dismantle or bypass defensive barriers, to avoid tissues with relatively high levels of defensive chemicals or to metabolize these chemicals once ingested. In addition, some herbivores interfere with the onset or completion of induced plant defences, resulting in the plant’s resistance being partly or fully suppressed. The ability to suppress induced plant defences appears to occur across plant parasites from different kingdoms, including herbivorous arthropods, and there is remarkable diversity in suppression mechanisms. Suppression may strongly affect the structure of the food web, because the ability to suppress the activation of defences of a communal host may facilitate competitors, whereas the ability of a herbivore to cope with activated plant defences will not. Further characterization of the mechanisms and traits that give rise to suppression of plant defences will enable us to determine their role in shaping direct and indirect interactions in food webs and the extent to which these determine the coexistence and persistence of species.},

  abstract = {The West Indian sweet potato weevil Euscepes postfasciatus (Fairmaire) is a troublesome pest insect of sweet potato that originally came from the Caribbean, but is now expanding its distribution into the Pacific Islands. Although sterile insect techniques have been used against this pest in a demonstration experiment on Kume Island [Ohno et al. (2006) Kontyu to Shizen 41:25–30], effective methods of monitoring E. postfasciatus are scarce. It is necessary to detect the weevils at an early stage of invasion in uninvaded areas, and an attractant trap can be used to achieve this. Thus, we developed an ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting diode trap, invented a method for diffusing the light to attract more insects, and investigated the attractiveness of the light trap to E. postfasciatus under laboratory conditions. Our results indicate that diffused UV light has a higher potential to attract E. postfasciatus than direct UV light. Furthermore, sweet potato is an effective bait to use to capture the weevils attracted by UV light. Thus, E. postfasciatus can be trapped using diffused UV light and sweet potato bait.},

We quantified volatile emissions fromNicotiana attenuata plants growing in natural populations during attack by three species of leaf-feeding herbivores and mimicked the release of five commonly emitted volatiles individually. Three compounds (cis-3-hexen-1-ol, linalool, and cis-α-bergamotene) increased egg predation rates by a generalist predator; linalool and the complete blend decreased lepidopteran oviposition rates. As a consequence, a plant could reduce the number of herbivores by more than 90\% by releasing volatiles. These results confirm that indirect defenses can operate in nature.},

However, flush on sweet orange was consistently more heavily infested with Asian citrus psyllid than kinnow flush; densities of Asian citrus psyllid eggs, nymphs, and adults were higher on sweet orange when compared with kinnow. When measured in terms of mean cumulative insect or Asian citrus psyllid days, eggs, nymphs, and adults were significantly higher on sweet orange than kinnow.

Little information is available on the susceptibility of the grapevine to this pest and its knowledge can be useful for a sustainable management of GEM. The present study was aimed at evaluating the responses of the plants to the infestation of GEM in order to compare the resistance/susceptibility of some native cultivars to this pest. Also, the profiling of JA, SA and IAA in leaves of infested plants of Sezdang was studied. The experiment was carried out on eighteen native cultivars and the non-native Muscat Gordo which were selected amongst the most common in southern and western Iran. Potted plants were cultivated under greenhouse conditions at a temperature of 32 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 3.8\textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$}C, 75 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 5\% R.H. and a photoperiod of L16: D8 h. The impact of GEM was evaluated on the basis of the leaf area and weight, number and size of the erinea, and percentage of leaves with erinea three months after the infestation. The cane length was measured, too. Mite density on galled leaves (three months after the infestation) and in buds (at the bud breaking) was assessed. Cluster analysis based on the leaf damage index induced by GEM allowed to distinguish highly affected (Sezdang, Khalili, Ghalati and Rishbaba), moderately affected (Neyshaboori, Gazne, Muscat, Lale, Shahani Sefid, Ahmad, Monagha and Sia) and scarcely affected (Yaghuti, Rotabi, White Thompson, Atabaki, Koladari and Sahebi and Shahani Gerd) cultivars. The mite density into the buds and on the galled leaves was higher in the medium-late (Rishbaba and Khalili) and late ripening (Sezdang and Ghalati) cultivars rather than in the early (Sahebi and Shahani Gerd) and early-medium (Atabaki) ripening ones. The leaf damaged area, the leaf weight, the shoot length and the erineum development were correlated to the mite density and were the highest on Sezdang, Khalili, Ghalati and Rishbaba and the lowest on Atabaki, Koladari, Sahebi and Shahani Gerd. The highest density of the overwintering population was detected in proximal buds of all treated cultivars. The plant responses and the mite density were investigated also in the second and third year after the first mite infestation on highly affected (Sezdang, Khalili, Ghalati, Rishbaba), a few of the moderately affected (Neyshaboori, Gazne, Muscat) and the scarcely affected cultivars (White Thompson, Atabaki, Koladari, Sahebi, Shahani Gerd). The leaf damaged area, the percentage of galled leaves, the percentage of cane length reduction and the mite density strongly decreased during all three years of observations on the highly affected Sezdang, Khalili and Gazne. On the contrary, Ghalati and Rishbaba displayed an increase of the leaf damaged area, leaf damaged index and mite density on galled leaves during the same period in comparison to the first year of observation. The percentage of the leaves with erinea, the leaf damaged area and the mite density of Sezdang were highly and positively correlated with IAA while a negative correlation was found between the leaf damaged area and the mite density with SA and JA in the assayed years. Almost all data currently collected allowed a recognition of White Thompson, Atabaki, Koladari, Sahebi and Shahani Gerd as the least affected cultivars.}

  abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) is one of the most destructive diseases in citrus worldwide. Unfortunately, HLB has no cure and management relies on insecticides to reduce populations of the vector, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae). We propose an attract-and-kill strategy using a trap crop as an alternative to vector control to reduce transmission of the pathogen, ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’. We evaluated vector response to phytoene desaturase-silenced citrus trees using virus-induced gene silencing technology. Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) was used to produce a phytoene desaturase-silenced citrus (CTV-tPDS) that expresses visual, olfactory, and gustatory cues to attract D. citri. We found that D. citri were more attracted to CTV-tPDS plants with noticeably better fecundity and overall population fitness than on control plants. Moreover, rearing D. citri on CTV-tPDS plants significantly increased their survival probability compared with those reared on control plants. CTV-tPDS plants possessed reduced content of both carotenoid and chlorophyll pigments resulting in a consistent photobleached phenotype on citrus leaves which provided a sufficient close-range visual attractant to stimulate D. citri landing. Additionally, CTV-tPDS plants exhibited an enriched profile of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which offered adequate olfactory cues to attract psyllid from long-range. Finally, CTV-tPDS plants exhibited an enriched metabolite content of phloem sap and leaves which offered appropriate gustatory cues that influenced probing/feeding behavior. We believe that introducing CTV-tPDS plants (as a trap crop) to D. citri-infested orchards will attract and congregate psyllids to facilitate their removal from the target crop with insecticides or by other means. This new strategy could be deployed relatively quickly and economically to HLB-impacted citrus industries. Moreover, it is an eco-friendly strategy because it should partially reduce the input of chemical insecticides ameliorating the indirect cost of HLB infection.},

  abstract = {Many insects, especially nocturnal insects, exhibit positive phototaxis to artificial lights. Light traps are currently used to monitor and manage insect pest populations, and play a crucial role in physical pest control. Efficient use of light traps to attract target insect pests is an important topic in the application of integrated pest management (IPM). Phototactic responses of insects vary among species, light characteristics and the physiological status of the insects. In addition, light can cause several biological responses, including biochemical, physiological, molecular and fitness changes in insects. In this review, we discuss several hypotheses on insect phototaxis, factors affecting insect phototaxis, insect-sensitive wavelengths, biological responses of insects to light, and countermeasures for conserving beneficial insects and increasing the effect of trapping. In addition, we provide information on the different sensitivities to wavelengths causing positive phototactic behavior in {$>$} 70 insect pest and beneficial insect species. The use of advanced light traps equipped with superior light sources, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), will make physical pest control in IPM more efficient. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Since its discovery in 2008, the pestiferous Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), has become widely established in residential citrus trees throughout southern California. In 2011, Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), a host-specific parasitoid of D. citri, sourced from Punjab Pakistan, was introduced into California as part of a classical biological program aimed at suppressing D. citri populations in urban areas. Despite these release efforts, little is known about the population dynamics of D. citri in urban citrus or the efficacy of T. radiata in controlling psyllid populations in urban-grown citrus. To address this shortcoming, the population phenology of D. citri was monitored biweekly for 2–3 yr on five different host plants (Rutaceae) at 11 residential sites across Riverside and Los Angeles Counties in southern California. Citrus flush growth patterns and parasitoid activity levels were also assessed. Urban D. citri populations were present year round at each site, with highest densities occurring over July through November. Temperature was an important indicator of overall D. citri densities with positive correlations across all life stages. Regularly flushing lime trees consistently supported the highest densities of psyllid eggs and nymphs, while equally vigorous flushing curry leaf plants supported the highest adult densities. While T. radiata activity was detected at all sites, average year-round percent parasitism was low throughout the study, averaging {$<$}5\% in 2012, 2013, and 2014.},

From 2014–2015, 116 experimental D. citri cohorts were monitored to determine survivorship, life table parameters, and marginal rates of mortality of immature D. citri at three sites in Riverside County, CA. D. citri cohorts of \$200 eggs were established on potted Citrus volkameriana (Rutaceae) plants. Field deployed cohorts were protected with fine or coarse mesh enclosures, sticky barriers, or left unprotected. Egg through adult emergence rates were used to assess the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors on psyllid survivorship rates by life stage. Predation of immature D. citri by larvae of Allograpta sp. (Diptera: Syrphidae) and Chrysoperla sp. (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) comprised 86\% of all observed predation mortality. When protected from all other arthropods, parasitism by Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) comprised 21\% of the total marginal rate of immature D. citri mortality from September to November in 2014 and 2015. Overall, D. citri net reproductive rates were reduced by 55–95\% when exposed to natural enemies, indicating the importance of the classical biological control agent, T. radiata, and generalist predators in reducing D. citri densities in urban areas of southern California.},

  abstract = {The construction of a general model of animal movement using the ‘experimental components' approach ofC. S. Holling is proposed. The process of ‘movement’ is interpreted very generally as any displacement of the whole organism in space. The rationale for modelling such processes rests upon the idea that there is a basic “canonical” pattern of movement characteristic of a species moving in a homogeneous environment, which pattern is overlaid by the various directional stimuli present in more usual heterogeneous environments. The ‘canonical movement model’ is a necessary first step in construction of more realistic representations. We suggest it can be made using six components viz. the initial heading of the animal, the mean and variance of the angular displacements made by the animal as it moves, the mean and variance of the speed of the animal, and a term for the continuity of the movement. We have measured all these components in the field for the two-dimensional movement of the inter-tidal snail, Polinices incei and these results are presented here. Difficulties inherent in the measure ment of angular displacement in particular are discussed and means of resolving them proposed. The shortcomings involved in the measurements and techniques for their more detailed representation and the next steps in the proposed modelling sequence are discussed.},

  abstract = {Predatory mites play the leading role in commercial augmentative biological control. They are mainly used in protected vegetable and ornamental cultivation systems to control phytophagous mites, thrips and whiteflies. Use in open-field systems and in animal husbandry is still limited. Phytoseiidae species are by far the most important group of commercially available mite biocontrol agents with about 20 species offered worldwide. Out of these, Amblyseius swirskii, Phytoseiulus persimilis, Neoseiulus cucumeris and Neoseiulus californicus are the most important ones, covering together about two thirds of the entire arthropod biocontrol agent market. The widespread use of these leaf-inhabiting predatory mites has stimulated research into their biology and we now have substantial knowledge on, for instance, the interaction between different predatory mite species, that helps to improve biocontrol programmes. Soil predatory mites, for example Stratiolaelaps scimitus (Laelapidae) or Macrocheles robustulus (Macrochelidae) for the control of sciarid fly larvae and thrips pupae are much less frequently used and also much less researched. This makes further development of biocontrol strategies using these mites more difficult. Currently, there appears to be no reliable method to quantify the abundance of these mites in soil samples. In studies at our laboratory, the frequently used Berlese-Tullgren funnels gave very variable results. We observed that soil predatory mites can even multiply during the extraction process. In addition to the control of plant pests, predatory mites can also be used to control parasites of animals like the poultry red mite, Dermanyssus gallinae. Good results have been obtained applying a combination of the predatory mites Androlaelaps casalis (Laelapidae) and Cheyletus eruditus (Cheyletidae) in laying hen stables. This paper provides an overview on the current status of commercial biological control using predatory mites and identifies research needs to make the currently available mite biocontrol agents even more successful and extend biological control with mites to other areas.},

During the experimental periods, in experiment 1, the mean dispersal distances from the release point were 5–6 m and in experiment 2 they were 6–12 m. Further examination of the relationship between dispersal distance and season is needed. The number of released D. citri declined with increasing distance from the release point and did not change markedly with time. The center of distribution moved little during the experimental period. These results suggest that the adult D. citri barely moved once they had colonized a host plant within a few days after their release. Our results also suggest that the released D. citri moved with the wind. The diffusion coefficient was estimated at 7.23 from experiment 1, but random diffusion might be a poor descriptor of the dispersal of adult D. citri.},

  abstract = {The behaviour of walking honeybees in small gradient odour fields was investigated by means of a simulation technique. The bee was kept in one place by a locomotion compensator (‘running sphere’). This compensator allowed for a precise reconstruction of the bee's actual locomotion on the sphere, and presented the bee with a stimulating odour whose concentration was controlled by feedback from the reconstructed locomotion. This rendered possible the application of well-defined odour fields and revealed that: (1) honeybees are capable of finding odour sources in the absence of optical cues and with concentration gradients too small to allow tropotactic or klinotactic orientation; (2) bees are capable of memorizing odour concentrations with a high degree of accuracy; (3) this orientation system is based on a switching over from negative to positive anemotaxis at a ‘reference’ concentration; (4) this reference is a function of the odour concentration at which a sugar reward is given. The results do not support any hypothesis for an orientation system based on the detection and comparison of successive values of odour concentration. A hypothesis on the nature of the ‘reference value’ is discussed and supported by experiments.},

  abstract = {The third edition of A Manual of Acarology has been a long time coming and took 10 years to produce! The second edition was published in 1978, but the third edition just arrived after 10 years of labor by the authors. Contributing authors include Valerie Behan-Pelletier, David R. Cook, Mark S. Harvey, James E. Keirans, Gerald W. Krantz, Evert E. Lindquist, Roy A. Norton, Barry M. O'Connor, Ian M. Smith, and David E. Walter. In the Preface, the editors acknowledge the extensive assistance of Marilyn Houck during 1999–2003 in the planning and preparation of this edition. Earlier editions of this book have long been a mainstay in acarology courses, especially when a laboratory is offered and students are taught how to use keys to identify mites to family. Like the previous editions, this hefty volume includes a brief introduction to acarine biology, phylogeny, morphology, ecology, and behavior. A chapter provides detailed information on how to collect and rear mites, as well as how to preserve and slidemount mites. There is an extensive bibliography (114 pages) as well as a systematic (19 pages) and a subject (12 pages) index. The bulk of the book contains up-to-date information on the classification of mites and keys. Individual chapters with diagnoses and keys are provided for the orders, suborders, and a cohort, with line drawings and other illustrations. Most chapters include keys to families (and in the case of the ticks, keys to genus). This volume includes a new ranking of mite groups compared to the 1978 edition. For example, the order Astigmata (or Acaridida, according to some) is placed in a cohort within the suborder Oribatida, a downgrading of its previous status. Significant other changes also were made in ranking, with the basis for these changes apparently based on morphological analyses rather than the use of molecular phylogenies. This edition indicates there are 6 orders (including the Opilioacaridida, Holothyrida, Ixodida, Mesostigmata, Trombidiformes, Sarcoptiformes) within the subclass Acari. The identification of mites to family with the keys requires that adult mites (often both males and females) be killed, fixed, and preserved before being slide-mounted for observation under a light microscope. To see the diagnostic characters used in the keys to family or genus, magnifications of 100–1000X are required, and a phase-contrast microscope is highly desirable. As noted by the authors, “Making a good slide mount requires practice and more than a modicum of patience. Pitfalls to be avoided include improper centering of the medium droplet on the slide, using too little medium to accommodate the coverslip, and failure to rinse reactive macerants from the specimen prior to transfer to the mounting medium.” Thus, for the novice, getting specimens properly prepared for identification with the keys in this volume is a substantial task. This volume will be useful to those who are teaching courses in acarology that include laboratories involving mite identification. It will be valuable to serious acarologists everywhere, as well as ecologists and others interested in this highly diverse group of arthropods. The update in references is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the orders. Information on the biology of mites is updated, although in abbreviated form, but those interested in learning more about a specific group may find references leading to more detailed information. Unfortunately, as Lindquist, Krantz, and Walter point out in Chapter 8, “Discoveries of new mite species, genera, and even families have continued apace, and many of these findings have challenged existing familiar- and generic-level concepts.” As a result, this volume may have a limited lifespan because new discoveries will lead to different perspectives in the placement of the acarine taxa. However, this valuable volume represents an enormous contribution of time and accumulated wisdom on the part of its expert authors. It would have been interesting if the authors had compared their ordinal, subordinal, and generic categories, based primarily on morphological traits, with molecular phylogenies. Mites are highly evolved and have lost many taxonomically useful characters; unlike insects, they lack antennae, wings (and thus, venation), and have lost their primitive segmentation patterns. Molecular data indicate that some ‘species’ include cryptic species, indicating that it is likely that the categories and keys presented will need modification as we identify new taxonomic groups. Despite this quibble, the volume clearly is a labor of love by dedicated acarologists, and is a very significant addition to the acarological literature. Enjoy this volume, because the field of acarology (and entomology) is losing skilled taxonomic specialists at a rapid rate, and any future editions of this book may be at least as long in coming as this one.},

  abstract = {Shiso (Perilla frutescens var. crispa) is widely grown as an important vegetable or herb crop in Japan. Beginning around the year 2000, occurrences of severe mosaic symptoms on shiso were documented and gradually spread across Kochi Prefecture, one of four major shiso production areas in Japan. Next generation sequencing and cloning indicated the presence of a previously unknown virus related to the members of the genus Emaravirus, for which we proposed the name Perilla mosaic virus (PerMV). The genome of PerMV consists of 10 RNA segments, each encoding a single protein in the negative-sense orientation. Of these proteins, P1, P2, P3a, P3b, P4, and P5 show amino acid sequence similarities with those of known emaraviruses, whereas no similarities were found in P6a, P6b, P6c, and P7. Characteristics of the RNA segments as well as phylogenetic analysis of P1 to P4 indicate that PerMV is a distinct and highly divergent emaravirus. Electron microscopy observations and protein analyses corresponded to presence of an emaravirus. Transmission experiments demonstrated that an eriophyid mite, Shevtchenkella sp. (family Eriophyidae), transmits PerMV with a minimum 30-min acquisition access period. Only plants belonging to the genus Perilla tested positive for PerMV, and the plant-virus-vector interactions were evaluated. The nucleotide sequences reported here are available in the DDBJ/ENA/GenBank databases under accession numbers LC496090 to LC496099.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is a fundamental biological process that operates at different temporal and spatial scales with consequences for individual fitness, population dynamics, population genetics, and species distributions. Studying this process is particularly challenging when the focus is on microscopic organisms that disperse passively, whilst controlling neither the transience nor the settlement phase of their movement. In this work we propose a comprehensive approach for studying passive dispersal of microscopic invertebrates and demonstrate it using wind and phoretic vectors. The protocol includes the construction of versatile, modifiable dispersal tunnels as well as a theoretical framework quantifying the movement of species via wind or vectors, and a hierarchical Bayesian approach appropriate to the structure of the dispersal data. The tunnels were used to investigate the three stages of dispersal (viz., departure, transience, and settlement) of two species of minute, phytophagous eriophyid mites Aceria tosichella and Abacarus hystrix. The proposed devices are inexpensive and easy to construct from readily sourced materials. Possible modifications enable studies of a wide range of mite species and facilitate manipulation of dispersal factors, thus opening a new important area of ecological study for many heretofore understudied species.},

We test the hypothesis that multimodal signals improve decision making in receivers by influencing the speed and the accuracy of their decisions. We trained bumble-bees (Bombus impatiens) to discriminate between artificial flowers that differed either in one modality, visual (specifically, shape) or olfactory, or in two modalities, visual plus olfactory. Bees trained on multimodal flowers learned the rewarding flowers faster than those trained on flowers that differed only in the visual modality and, in extinction trials, visited the previously rewarded flowers at a higher rate than bees trained on unimodal flowers. Overall, bees showed a speed–accuracy trade-off; bees that made slower decisions achieved higher accuracy levels. Foraging on multimodal flowers did not affect the slope of the speed–accuracy relationship, but resulted in a higher intercept, indicating that multimodal signals were associated with consistently higher accuracy across range of decision speeds. Our results suggest that bees make more effective decisions when flowers signal in more than one modality, and confirm the importance of studying signal components together rather than separately.},

  abstract = {Food-deceptive flowers are pollinated by animals that expect a reward but are cheated. Such plants profit from their similarity to rewarding plants and should develop signals that hinder discrimination. We use artificial rewarding model flowers and nonrewarding mimicking flowers that present similar visual cues. We test how additional scent cues change flower choice of the mimic by bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) in two situations: (1) both flower types are simultaneously present and can be compared by the pollinator, and (2) both flower types are encountered successively in the absence of each other. We find that in situation 1, discrimination learning is greater if scents are used as cues for identifying the mimic, whether the mimic has a different scent or if it is scentless while the model is scented. In situation 2, a generalization task, a scented mimic is avoided faster than a scentless one. Discrimination of the mimic is poorest if it has the same scent as the model, thus demonstrating a potential for scent mimicry, which has not yet been proved to exist among differently rewarding flowers. Thus, the best strategy for a mimic would be to have the same scent as the model, but this strategy may not be used due to evolutionary constraints. Alternatively, if there are several potential models, then having no scent would be a better strategy than mimicking just one of the models. In situation 1 flower discrimination by color cues is enhanced in the mere presence of scent, compared to unscented controls, even if the scent does not provide a distinguishable cue itself. The results indicate that the presence of scent may enhance color discrimination by improving attention towards visual cues and/or that combined color/odor cues may lead to better memory formation and retrieval.},

  abstract = {The sexual behavior of phytophagous insects is often integrated in a variety of ways with their host plants. This integration may be manifested as effects or influences of host plants on insect physiology and behavior, including sex pheromone communication, that reflect strategies by insects to optimize mating and reproduction. Certain insects sequester or otherwise acquire host plant compounds and use them as sex pheromones or sex pheromone precursors. Other insects produce or release sex pheromones in response to particular host plant cues. Chemicals from host plants often synergize or otherwise enhance insect responses to sex pheromones. By these means, host plants may be used by insects to regulate or mediate sexual communication. For many species of insects, host plant influences on insect sex pheromone communication may be important aspects of the formation of feeding and mating aggregations, of insect strategies to locate both hosts and mates, of behavioral reproductive isolation among sibling species, and of the regulation of reproduction to coincide with the availability of food and oviposition sites. Knowledge of these relationships is critical to understanding many different areas of the behavioral ecology of plant-feeding insects.},

Pheromones are chemical signals from one organism that stimulate a response in another individual of the same species. Most sex pheromones stimulate behavior directly related to mating. Generally, this behavior is either attraction to the opposite sex or part of courtship interaction. Sex pheromones that stimulate orientation responses of one sex to the other and serve to bring males and females together for initiation of courtship and mating are referred to here as sex attractants or sex attractant pheromones . Although there is considerable variation in how sex attractant pheromones function in the mate-finding strategies of insects, the norm (and often the expected) involves a sex pheromone produced by the female that is attractive to males. A rather small percentage of sex attractants is produced by males.},

Diet incorporation of lyophilized roots of T. candida into an artificial diet increasingly inhibited the growth of larvae and increased larval mortality with increased concentration of roots, whereas roots from C. macrophylla or T. vogelii had no effect compared with the diet-only control. T. candida, but not T. vogelii, contains at least one constituent that acts as an antifeedant toward adult D. abbreviatus and as a toxicant toward larvae. No antifeedant effect of roots of T. candida toward larvae was observed in no-choice pot tests or in a diet incorporation bioassay. In pots, larval feeding damage to roots of T. candida was evident. In the diet incorporation assay, 97\% of larvae survived 29 d on a diet of cellulose powder (a nutritionally inert filler) despite losing weight. We conclude that decreased survival and weight gain of larvae-fed fresh or lyophilized roots of T. candida were the result of ingestion of a toxicant and not deterrence from feeding.},

Negative effects of copper on insect development were observed only for early instars. Survival of larvae from hatching to 4 weeks of age was significantly affected by the copper compounds compared with the artificial diet alone, and greater mortality was associated with CuSO4 compared with Cu(OH)2. The two compounds had equivalent effects on larval weight gain of early instars. Weight gain was negatively correlated with increasing copper concentration. No effect of copper was observed on late instars maintained on these diets beyond the initial 4 weeks. Larval and pupal period, weight gain, and survival of late instars were statistically similar. No effect on larval survival or weight gain was observed when copper solutions were applied at nonphytotoxic levels to two varieties of citrus rootstock. The potential for manipulating citrus tree copper content to control this pest is discussed.},

  abstract = {The tropical root weevil, Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.), has been a pest of citrus and ornamental plants since its introduction into Lake County, FL, in 1964. Since then, it has colonized the Florida peninsula to the south of its point of introduction but has not expanded its range to the north. A lower threshold for oviposition by D. abbreviatus was estimated as 14.9°C. Eggs were highly susceptible to cold, with 95\% mortality (LTime95) occurring in 4.2 d at 12°C. Relative susceptibility of life stages to cold was eggs \&gt; pupae \&gt; larvae \&gt; adults. Archived weather data from Florida were examined to guide a mapping exercise using the lower developmental threshold for larvae (12°C) and the lower threshold for oviposition (15°C) as critical temperatures for mapping the distribution of D. abbreviatus and the potential for establishment of egg parasitoids. Probability maps using the last 10 yr of weather data examined the frequency of at least 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 d per winter when soil temperature was ≤12°C. The geographic area that experienced between 15 and 20 d per winter with mean daily soil temperature ≤12°C closely approximated the northern limit of D. abbreviatus in Florida. Homologous maps of Arizona, California, and Texas predict the areas where soil temperatures favor establishment of D. abbreviatus. Successful establishment of egg parasitoids in Florida seems to be limited to southern Florida, where mean daily air temperatures fall below 15°C \&lt;25 d/yr. By this measure, we predict that egg parasitoids will not establish in Arizona, California, or Texas.},

  abstract = {Development or improvement of artificial insect diets can be tedious, convoluted and often under-appreciated. Using n-dimensional mixture designs, we identified a set of response-optimized meridic diets that contain fewer ingredients than the current commercial diet for Diaprepes abbreviatus, a polyphagous weevil pest of the Caribbean and southern U.S. A diet blend optimized to produce maximum adult weight was predicted to produce adult D. abbreviatus that weigh 28\% more compared with adults reared on the standard commercial diet. Diet blends that produced greater individual adult weights resulted in lower survival compared with those blends that yielded adults of more modest proportions. In contrast, a simplified high cottonseed meal blend produced smaller adults more similar to field-collected individuals, and produced the greatest number of adults and the greatest biomass at relatively low cost compared with diets that yielded adult weevils of greater weight. We think that many insect-rearing programs would benefit from application of mixture design methods to situations where diet optimization is desired for researcher-selected criteria. This approach is broadly applicable to any problem that can be conceptualized as a mixture problem.},

  abstract = {A semiochemical-based attractant for the tropical root weevil, Diaprepes abbreviatus L., has been sought since the introduction of this polyphagous pest to Florida in the 1960s. A six-unit wind tunnel apparatus was constructed to allow multiple runs to be conducted simultaneously to test the response of D. abbreviatus adults to volatile and contact semiochemicals. Arrestment was measured as the number of weevils stopping and remaining on a target when presented with upwind target choices. No response (movement upwind) was observed when weevils were presented with a control (no odor). Some movement upwind but no arrestment occurred when weevils were presented with young citrus leaves (ßush). Citrus ßush that had been fed on by D. abbreviatus adults was highly attractive and induced arrestment of both male and female adults. The effect was duplicated by placing organdy-enclosed feces (frass) on undamaged ßush. The arrestment effect was eliminated, however, when fed-on ßush was enclosed in a cage so that weevils could not contact the leaves. In these experiments, weevils continued to move upwind. The results of these tests lead us to conclude that host and mate location by D. abbreviatus is mediated by volatile and contact semiochemicals.},

The weight of weevils reared on F1675 was more than twice as great as field-collected individuals. Recently, several ingredients included in the original F1675 diet were shown to have little or no effect on insect performance. We examined the effects of varying three ingredients of a simplified diet on the weight of adult D. abbreviatus. We used a geometric design combined with response surface models to evaluate the effects of the amount and proportion of diet ingredients to identify optimal diet recipes for normative weight gain defined in relation to field-collected D. abbreviatus from locations in Florida. Our results showed that it is possible to produce adults of normative weight or, for that matter, any mean weight within a wide range by varying the proportions of cottonseed meal, wheat germ and cellulose, a non-nutritive filler. Although wheat germ contributed to greater weight gain, survival of larvae to adult was lower on diets containing only wheat germ compared with diets containing only cottonseed meal as the principal nutritive components. The analyses of all the variables measured indicate that cottonseed meal is the only major nutritive component, in addition to standard vitamin and salt mixes, required to produce adult D. abbreviatus of normative weight.},

The activity of the synthetic E-isomer was confirmed by GC-EAD, GC-MS, NMR, and bioassays. No antennal response was observed to the Z-isomer or the lactone. In a two-choice olfactometer bioassay, female D. abbreviatus moved upwind towards the synthetic pheromone or natural pheromone more often compared with clean air. Males showed no clear preference for the synthetic pheromone. This pheromone, alone or in combination with plant volatiles, may play a role in the location of males by female D. abbreviatus.},

Early success with this approach was overshadowed by the expense and difficulty of application, and variation in wax component chemistry that contributed to reduced longevity of pheromone emission in the field. Solid elastomer dispensers (DCEPT CLM™, ISCA Technologies, Inc.) loaded with a 3:1 blend of (Z,Z,E)7,11,13-hexadecatrienal and (Z,Z)-7,11-hexadecadienal, the major components of the P. citrella sex pheromone, provided disruption of trap catch in commercial citrus orchards for periods exceeding 30 wk. The triene component alone worked as well as or better than the 3:1 blend. The height of dispensers placed by hand in the tree canopy had a significant effect on trap shutdown. Dispensers placed low (0.6 m) in the canopy resulted in a reduction of trap shutdown in the upper third ({$>$}3 m) of the canopy suggesting that the net movement of pheromone molecules was downward during the period of active moth flight. Although moth flight appeared equivalent among the heights tested, placement of dispensers higher in the canopy appears more effective given this downward movement of pheromone plumes. These studies suggest that season-long trap catch disruption can be attained in citrus with a single application of a hand-applied dispenser.},

The use of citrus flushing and ACP monitoring tools is essential for the knowledge of the occurrence pattern of cycles of both and for the improvement of the ACP management. During 3 years, 20 branches from 20 trees were evaluated for vegetative flushing, ACP abundance, and occupation in tree and branches in a Brazilian citrus area free for HLB. The obtained data was investigated through spectral and co-spectral analyses. Four to 12 flush shoot cycles occurred per year, which were similar to abundance and occupation cycles of ACP, with an apparent synchronization between these variables. In general, there was a difference from 14 to 19 days between flushing and ACP peaks, with an occurrence of the flushing peaks before the ACP peaks. Results will provide useful information to citrus growers and agricultural defense agencies to apply a suitable and targeted ACP management, which will avoid or delay the disease entrance into still free HLB areas. In addition, the modeling of occupation and abundance cycles of vectors as applied in this study may be useful for other pathosystems which insect vectors are associated or even in the intrusion monitoring programs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is one of the most serious pests of citrus in the world, because it transmits the pathogen that causes citrus greening disease. To determine genetic variation among geographic populations of D. citri, microsatellite markers, mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) and the Wolbachia–Diaphorina, wDi, gene wsp sequence data were used to characterize Iranian and Pakistani populations. Also, a Bayesian phylogenetic technique was utilized to elucidate the relationships among the sequences data in this study and all mtCOI and wsp sequence data available in GenBank and the Wolbachia database. RESULTS: Microsatellite markers revealed significant genetic differentiation among Iranian populations, as well as between Iranian and Pakistani populations (FST = 0.0428, p {$<$} 0.01). Within Iran, the Sistan–Baluchestan population is significantly different from the Hormozgan (Fareghan) and Fars populations. By contrast, mtCOI data revealed two polymorphic sites separating the sequences from Iran and Pakistan. Global phylogenetic analyses showed that D. citri populations in Iran, India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Mexico, Florida and Texas (USA) are similar. Wolbachia, wDi, wsp sequences were similar among Iranian populations, but different between Iranian and Pakistani populations. CONCLUSION: The South West Asia (SWA) group is the most likely source of the introduced Iranian populations of D. citri. This assertion is also supported by the sequence similarity of the Wolbachia, wDi, strains from the Florida, USA and Iranian D. citri. These results should be considered when looking for biological controls in either country.},

  abstract = {The tiny size of eriophyoid mites is a key feature regarding their status as herbivorous pests. Many eriophyoid species are highly hostspecific and live in concealed sites (refuges) on their hosts, which are difficult to access by natural enemies. We explored the spatial refugeused by one of the most important coconut pests, the coconut miteAceria guerreronisKeifer (Eriophyidae). Based on the assumptionthatA. guerreronisshifted its habitat under the perianth of coconut to avoid competition and/or escape from predation we investigatedthe fine scale spatial distribution ofA. guerreronisand associated competitors and predators. Coconut fruits were sectioned and discretechambers identified under the perianth.A. guerreroniswas present on 92\% of fruits and by far the most abundant mite under the peri-anth. It preferentially resided in the tightest chambers to the fruit surface. Another herbivore,Steneotarsonemus furcatusDe Leon (Tarso-nemidae) was found on 30\% of fruits most of which were simultaneously occupied byA. guerreronis.Neoseiulus barakiAthias-Henriot(Phytoseiidae) was the predominant predatory mite ( 35\% of fruits) followed byProctolaelaps bickleyiBram (Ascidae) ( 7\% of fruits).A. guerreronis,S. furcatusandN. barakishowed a slightly different but more similar repartition among chambers under the perianth thanP. bickleyi. Overall, our study suggests that refuge use byA. guerreronisis a key issue for its natural and/or biological control. Potentialcontrol strategies are discussed.},

This study described the association of CiLV-C2 movement protein (MP) and capsid protein (p29) with biological membranes. Our findings obtained by computer predictions, chemical treatments after membrane fractionation, and biomolecular fluorescence complementation assays revealed that p29 is peripherally associated, while the MP is integrally bound to the cell membranes. Topological analyses revealed that both the p29 and MP expose their N- and C-termini to the cell cytoplasmic compartment. The implications of these results in the intracellular movement of the virus were discussed.},

  abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) is a bacterial infection of citrus trees transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid               Diaphorina citri               . Mitigation of HLB has focused on spraying of insecticides to reduce the psyllid population and removal of trees when they first show symptoms of the disease. These interventions have been only marginally effective, because symptoms of HLB do not appear on leaves for months to years after initial infection. Limited knowledge about disease spread during the asymptomatic phase is exemplified by the heretofore unknown length of time from initial infection of newly developing cluster of young leaves, called flush, by adult psyllids until the flush become infectious. We present experimental evidence showing that young flush become infectious within 15 d after receiving an inoculum of               Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus               (bacteria). Using this critical fact, we specify a microsimulation model of asymptomatic disease spread and intensity in a grove of citrus trees. We apply a range of psyllid introduction scenarios to show that entire groves can become infected with up to 12,000 psyllids per tree in less than 1 y, before most of the trees show any symptoms. We also show that intervention strategies that reduce the psyllid population by 75\% during the flushing periods can delay infection of a full grove, and thereby reduce the amount of insecticide used throughout a year. This result implies that psyllid surveillance and control, using a variety of recently available technologies, should be used from the initial detection of invasion and throughout the asymptomatic period.},

  abstract = {The dry bulb mite, Aceria tulipae, is the most important pest of stored tulip bulbs in The Netherlands. This tiny, eriophyoid mite hides in the narrow space between scales in the interior of the bulb. To achieve biological control of this hidden pest, candidate predators small enough to move in between the bulb scales are required. Earlier experiments have shown this potential for the phytoseiid mite, Neoseiulus cucumeris, but only after the bulbs were exposed to ethylene, a plant hormone that causes a slight increase in the distance between tulip bulb scales, just sufficient to allow this predator to reach the interior part of the bulb. Applying ethylene, however, is not an option in practice because it causes malformation of tulip flowers. In fact, to prevent this cosmetic damage, bulb growers ventilate rooms where tulip bulbs are stored, thereby removing ethylene produced by the bulbs (e.g. in response to mite or fungus infestation). Recently, studies on the role of predatory mites in controlling another eriophyoid mite on coconuts led to the discovery of an exceptionally small phytoseiid mite, Neoseiulus paspalivorus. This predator is able to move under the perianth of coconuts where coconut mites feed on meristematic tissue of the fruit. This discovery prompted us to test N. paspalivorus for its ability to control A. tulipae on tulip bulbs under storage conditions (ventilated rooms with bulbs in open boxes; 23 °C; storage period June-October). Using destructive sampling we monitored predator and prey populations in two series of replicated experiments, one at a high initial level of dry bulb mite infestation, late in the storage period, and another at a low initial dry bulb mite infestation, halfway the storage period. The first and the second series involved treatment with N. paspalivorus and a control experiment, but the second series had an additional treatment in which the predator N. cucumeris was released. Taking the two series of experiments together we found that N. paspalivorus controlled the populations of dry bulb mites both on the outer scale of the bulbs as well as in the interior part of the bulbs, whereas N. cucumeris significantly reduced the population of dry bulb mites on the outer scale, but not in the interior part of the bulb. Moreover, N. paspalivorus was found predominantly inside the bulb, whereas N. cucumeris was only found on the outer scale, thereby confirming our hypothesis that the small size of N. paspalivorus facilitates access to the interior of the bulbs. We argue that N. paspalivorus is a promising candidate for the biological control of dry bulb mites on tulip bulbs under storage conditions in the Netherlands.},

  abstract = {The development, survivorship, longevity, reproduction, and life table parameters of the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama were evaluated at 10°C, 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, 28°C, 30°C and 33°C. The populations reared at 10°C and 33°C failed to develop. Between 15°C and 30°C, mean developmental period from egg to adult varied from 49.3 days at 15°C to 14.1 days at 28°C. The low-temperature developmental thresholds for 1st through 5th instars were estimated at 11.7°C, 10.7°C, 10.1°C, 10.5°C and 10.9°C, respectively. A modified Logan model was used to describe the relationship between developmental rate and temperature. The survival of the 3rd through 5th nymphal instars at 15-28°C was essentially the same. The mean longevity of females increased with decreasing temperature within 15-30°C. The maximal longevity of individual females was recorded 117, 60, 56, 52 and 51 days at 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, 28°C and 30°C, respectively. The average number of eggs produced per female significantly increased with increasing temperature and reached a maximum of 748.3 eggs at 28°C (P {$<$} 0.001). The population reared at 28°C had the highest intrinsic rate of increased (0.199) and net reproductive rate (292.2); and the shortest population doubling time (3.5 days) and mean generation time (28.6 days) compared with populations reared at 1525°C. The optimum range of temperatures for D. citri population growth was 25-28°C.},

  abstract = {One of the most cited hypotheses explaining the inordinate success of a small proportion of introduced plants that become pests is the ‘natural enemies hypothesis’. This states that invasive introduced plants spread rapidly because they are liberated from their co-evolved natural enemies. This hypothesis had not been properly tested until recently. Previous reviews on this topic have been narrative and vote counting in nature. In this review, we carried out quantitative synthesis and meta-analysis using existing literature on plants and their herbivores to test the different components of the enemy release hypothesis. We found supporting evidence in that (1) insect herbivore fauna richness is significantly greater in the native than introduced ranges, and the reduction is skewed disproportionally towards specialists and insects feeding on reproductive parts; and (2) herbivore damage levels are greater on native plants than on introduced invasive congeners. However, herbivore damage levels are only marginally greater for plants in native than in introduced ranges, probably due to the small numbers of this type of study. Studies quantifying herbivore impacts on plant population dynamics are too scarce to make conclusions for either comparison of plants in native vs introduced ranges or of co-occurring native and introduced congeners. For future research, we advocate that more than two-way comparisons between plants in native and introduced ranges, or native and introduced congeners are needed. In addition, the use of herbivore exclusions to quantify the impacts of herbivory on complete sets of population vital rates of native vs introduced species are highly desirable. Furthermore, three-way comparisons among congeners of native plants, introduced invasive, and introduced non-invasive plants can also shed light on the importance of enemy release. Finally, simultaneously testing the enemy release hypothesis and other competing hypotheses will provide significant insights into the mechanisms governing the undesirable success of invasive species.},

  abstract = {Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) is a phytophagous insect and the vector of the bacterium 'Candidatus' Liberibacter asiaticus. This is the likely causal pathogen of huanglongbing, which results in decline and possible death of citrus trees. It has been shown that host plants can affect the detoxification enzyme profile of arthropods. Here, we examined the effect of rearing D. citri on various host plant species with respect to activity of general esterases (ESTs), glutathione S-transferases (GST), and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s). These enzymes were selected because they are known to metabolize a wide diversity of insecticides and are known to directly contribute to resistance in D. citri. We reared D. citri on Citrus sinensis L., Bergera koenigii L. and Murraya paniculata (L.) Jacq. (Sapindales: Rutaceae). Following 12 generations of rearing, the activities of EST, GST, and P450 enzymes were compared between the colonies raised on the different host plants. The GST activity level was significantly higher in D. citri reared on M. paniculata than in those reared on C. sinensis. The P450 expression level was significantly higher in D. citri reared on M. paniculata than in those reared on either B. koenigii or C. sinensis. There was no significant difference in EST activity between treatments. These results suggest that host plant allelochemicals may alter the detoxification enzyme system in D. citri. However, these changes did not correlate with changes in mortality of D. citri when treated with fenpropathrin. Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) es un insecto fitófago y el vector de la bacteria 'Candidatus' Liberibacter asiaticus. Este es el patógeno causal probable de Huanglongbing, que resulta el declive y posible muerte de los árboles de cítricos. Se ha demostrado que las plantas hospederas pueden afectar el perfil de enzimas de desintoxicación de los artrópodos. Aquí, hemos examinado el efecto de críar D. citri sobre varias especies de plantas hospederas con respecto a la actividad de las esterasas generales (ESTs), glutatión S-transferasas (GST), y monooxigenasas del citocromo P450 (P450s). Estas enzimas fueron seleccionados porque son conocidos para metabolizar una amplia diversidad de insecticidas y se sabe que contribuyen directamente a la resistencia de D. citri. Se crió D. citri sobre Citrus sinensis L., Bergera koenigii L. y Murraya paniculata (L.) Jacq. (Sapindales: Rutaceae). Después de 12 generaciones de cría, se compararon las actividades de EST, GST y las enzimas P450 entre las colonias criadas sobre las diferentes plantas hospederas. El nivel de actividad GST fue significativamente mayor en D. citri criados sobre M. paniculata que en aquellos criados sobre C. sinensis. El nivel de expresión P450 fue significativamente mayor en D. citri criados en M. paniculata que en ambos B. koenigii o C. sinensis. No hubo una diferencia significativa en la actividad EST entre los tratamientos. Estos resultados sugieren que los aleloquímicos de plantas hospederas pueden alterar el sistema de enzimas de desintoxicación en D. citri. Sin embargo, estos cambios no se correlacionaron con cambios en la mortalidad de D. citri cuando son tratados con fenpropatrina.},

In the present study, a Y-tube olfactometer was employed to investigate whether the parasitoid T. radiata is capable of utilizing the odour source emitted by both plants and insect hosts during its foraging. The odour sources included Murraya paniculata (L.) shoots, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th D. citri instar nymphs, both individually and in combinations. Moreover, nymph-stage choice for parasitism, including 3rd, 4th, and 5th D. citri instar nymphs, was carried out. The results indicated that female T. radiata were only significantly attracted to volatiles emitted by M. paniculata shoots, 3rd, 4th, and 5th instar nymphs of D. citri, but could not distinguish between them. T. radiata males were not attracted by odours sourced from any instar D. citri nymphs. Female T. radiata adults exhibited a significant preference to later instar nymphal stages of D. citri for oviposition. The results from this study can be used to guide further investigations on the searching behaviour of this parasitoid and its utilization in D. citri biocontrol.},

This northbound spread of CiLV is being considered a serious threat to the citrus industry of the United States. However, despite its importance, difficulties related to the biology of CiLV have hindered much of the progress regarding its accurate detection, leaving both the analyses of symptoms and electron microscopy as the only tools available. An attempt to overcome this problem was made by constructing a cDNA library from double-stranded RNA extracted from leprosis lesions of infected Citrus sinensis (sweet orange) leaves. After cloning and sequencing, specific primers were designed to amplify putative CiLV genome regions with similarity to genes encoding the movement protein and replicase of other plant viruses. RNA from infected citrus plants corresponding to different varieties and locations were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the two pairs of primers. Amplified products were purified, cloned in pGEM-T, and sequenced. The sequences confirmed the genomic regions previously associated with CiLV. The results demonstrate that RT-PCR was specific, accurate, rapid, and reliable for the detection of CiLV.},

In this study, the adaptability and CLas titres of D. citri adults on three weed species, namely, Ageratum conyzoides, Solanum nigrum and Praxelis clematidea, which are widely distributed in citrus orchards in China, were determined. RESULTS D. citri selected S. nigrum preferentially over the other weed species. The longest survival times of D. citri adults on A. conyzoides, S. nigrum and P. clematidea were 48, 41 and 11 days, respectively. On S. nigrum, the survivorship of females was significantly higher than that of males. The CLas titres of D. citri adults feeding on the three weeds for 1 week increased significantly during autumn but did not change significantly during spring. Conversely, the titres of adults on citrus increased significantly during spring but did not change significantly during autumn. CONCLUSION D. citri exhibited different adaptabilities to the three weed species, but the CLas titres of D. citri adults did not decrease on any of the weeds. These results suggested that the three weed species could help dispersing of D. citri and transmission of CLas while ideal host conditions were scarce or absent.}

Making this decision demands constant follow-up of the culture through periodic sampling where knowledge about the spatial distribution of the pest is a fundamental part to improve sampling and control decisions. The objective of this work was to study the spatial distribution pattern and build a sequential sampling plan for the pest. The data used were gathered from two blocks of Valencia sweet orange on a farm in São Paulo State, Brazil, by 40 inspectors trained for the data collection. The following aggregation indices were calculated: variance/ mean ratio, Morisita index, Green’s coefficient, and k parameter of the negative binomial distribution. The data were tested for fit with Poisson and negative binomial distributions using the chi-square goodness of fit test. The sequential sampling was developed using Wald’s Sequential Probability Ratio Test and validated through simulations. We concluded that the spatial distribution of B. phoenicis is aggregated, its behavior best fitted to the negative binomial distribution and we built and validated a sequential sampling plan for control decision-making. Index terms red and black flat mite; negative binomial; Poisson distribution; decision making; integrated pest management},

We examined the olfactory responses of T. radiata to volatiles emanating from D. citri or plant volatiles using a custom designed T-maze olfactometer and open arena bioassays. We also examined the behavioral response of male and female T. radiata to conspecifics of the opposite sex to determine whether olfactory signals mediate mate location. T. radiata adults exhibited a sexually dimorphic response to volatiles emanating from D. citri and citrus. Female T. radiata responded positively to the odors emanating from D. citri nymphs in both olfactometer and open arena bioassays. However, female wasps showed no response to odors emanating from D. citri adults, D. citri honey dew secretions, intact citrus or orange jasmine leaves. Odors emanating from D. citri damaged citrus were not attractive to T. radiata females but stimulated attraction of wasps to D. citri on damaged plants. T. radiata females were not attracted to D. citri immatures when they were presented as visual cues. Male T. radiata did not show attraction to D. citri nymphs or other putative odors that were attractive to female T. radiata. In olfactometer bioassays, more male T. radiata responded to the odor of female conspecifics than blank controls in the absence of associated citrus host plant volatiles. Odors emanating from female T. radiata were not attractive to male T. radiata. Male or female T. radiata were not attracted to the odors emanating from same sex conspecifics. Both male and female T. radiata adults showed positive phototactic behavior. Collectively, our results provide behavioral evidence that: 1) female T. radiata use volatiles emanating from D. citri nymphs to locate its host and: 2) female T. radiata release a volatile pheromone that attracts male conspecifics.},

The bacterium is the presumed causal agent of huanglongbing (HLB), one of the most destructive and economically important diseases of citrus. We investigated whether Las is transmitted between infected and uninfected D. citri adults during courtship. Our results indicate that Las was sexually transmitted from Las-infected male D. citri to uninfected females at a low rate (,4\%) during mating. Sexual transmission was not observed following mating of infected females and uninfected males or among adult pairs of the same sex. Las was detected in genitalia of both sexes and also in eggs of infected females. A latent period of 7 days or more was required to detect the bacterium in recipient females. Rod shaped as well as spherical structures resembling Las were observed in ovaries of Las-infected females with transmission electron microscopy, but were absent in ovaries from uninfected D. citri females. The size of the rod shaped structures varied from 0.39 to 0.67 mm in length and 0.19 to 0.39 mm in width. The spherical structures measured from 0.61 to 0.80 mm in diameter. This investigation provides convincing evidence that a plant pathogenic bacterium is sexually transmitted from male to female insects during courtship and established evidence that bacteria persist in reproductive organs. Moreover, these findings provide an alternative sexually horizontal mechanism for the spread of Las within populations of D. citri, even in the absence of infected host trees.},

D. citri generally rely on olfaction and vision for detection of host cues. Certain plant volatiles and plant-derived essential oil products are known to repel several arthropod species and are considered minimumrisk pesticides. We examined the effect of five essential oils and eight chemicals previously reported to have activity against various insect species on D. citri behaviour in a two-port divided T-olfactometer in an effort to identify repellents for further consideration and testing as crop protectants for D. citi. Volatiles from essential oils of coriander, lavender, rose, thyme, tea tree oil and 2-undecanone, a major constituent of rue oil repelled D. citri adults compared with clean air. Also, coriander, lavender, rose and thyme oil inhibited the response of D. citri when co-presented with citrus leaves. Volatiles from eugenol, eucalyptol, carvacrol, b-caryophyllene, a-pinene, a-gurjunene and linalool did not repel D. citri adults compared with clean air. In an effort to isolate the repellents and toxicants from effective essential oils, the headspace components of coriander and lavender oil were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and revealed that a-pinene and linalool were the primary volatiles present in coriander oil while linalool and linalyl acetate were the primary volatiles present in lavender oil. Coriander, lavender and garlic chive oils were also highly toxic to D. citri when evaluated as contact action insecticides using a topical application technique. The LC50 values for these three oils ranged between 0.16 and 0.25 lg/D. citri adult while LC50 values for rose and thyme oil ranged between 2.45 and 17.26 lg/insect.},

Live oak (Quercus virginiana Mill.), silver buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus L. variety sericeus Fors. Ex DC), and black olive (Bucida buseras L.) had the highest percentage of plants with egg masses. Adult feeding damage was found on all examined plants of dahoon holly (Ilex cassine L.), cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco L.), black olive, live oak, Bauhinia sp., and Cassia sp. Oviposition of D. abbreviatus was evaluated in no-choice, two-choice, three-choice and multiple-choice caged tests. In no-choice tests, silver buttonwood had the highest mean number of egg masses. In two-choice tests, egg masses were laid on all plant species tested but there were significantly more egg masses on silver buttonwood than the alternate choice. The number of egg masses in the three-choice tests was low and there were no significant differences among the plant species tested. As in the no-choice and two-choice tests, significantly more egg masses were found on silver buttonwood in multiple-choice tests. Survival of larvae and their effect on plant growth was examined on several commonly grown plant species in southern Florida. Larval survival was highest on silver buttonwood and Sorghum sudanense Pers (sorghum-sudan) compared with other plant species. Root and/or total biomass was significantly reduced on green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), silver buttonwood, Tahiti lime (Citrus aurantifolia), and sorghum-sudan.},

  abstract = {Understanding biological mechanisms that regulate emergence of viral diseases, in particular those events engaging cross-species pathogens spillover, is becoming increasingly important in virology. Species barrier jumping has been extensively studied in animal viruses, and the critical role of a suitable intermediate host in animal viruses-generated human pandemics is highly topical. However, studies on host jumping involving plant viruses have been focused on shifting intra-species, leaving aside the putative role of “bridge hosts” in facilitating interspecies crossing. Here, we take advantage of several VPg mutants, derived from a chimeric construct of the potyvirus Plum pox virus (PPV), analyzing its differential behaviour in three herbaceous species. Our results showed that two VPg mutations in a Nicotiana clevelandii-adapted virus, emerged during adaptation to the bridge-host Arabidopsis thaliana, drastically prompted partial adaptation to Chenopodium foetidum. Although both changes are expected to facilitate productive interactions with eIF(iso)4E, polymorphims detected in PPV VPg and the three eIF(iso)4E studied, extrapolated to a recent VPg:eIF4E structural model, suggested that two adaptation ways can be operating. Remarkably, we found that VPg mutations driving host-range expansion in two non-related species, not only are not associated with cost trade-off constraints in the original host, but also improve fitness on it.

  abstract = {Interactions between plant pathogens and arthropods have been predominantly studied through the prism of herbivorous arthropods. Currently, little is known about the effect of plant pathogens on the third trophic level. This question is particularly interesting in cases where pathogens manipulate host phenotype to increase vector attraction and presumably increase their own proliferation. Indeed, a predator or a parasitoid of a vector may take advantage of this manipulated phenotype to increase its foraging performance. We explored the case of a bacterial pathogen, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), which modifies the odors released by its host plant (citrus trees) to attract its vector, the psyllid Diaphorina citri. We found that the specialist parasitoid of D. citri, Tamarixia radiata, was attracted more toward Las-infected than uninfected plants. We demonstrated that this attractiveness was due to the release of methyl salicylate. Parasitization of D. citri nymphs on Las-infected plants was higher than on uninfected controls. Also, parasitization was higher on uninfected plants baited with methyl salicylate than on non-baited controls. This is the first report of a parasitoid “eavesdropping” on a plant volatile induced by bacterial pathogen infection, which also increases effectiveness of host seeking behavior of its herbivorous vector.},

  abstract = {Densities of an herbivorous pest may be impacted by landscape and orchard architecture. We present two orchard experiments where the densities of the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) were compared depending on: (1) the presence or absence of a windbreak and (2) if the orchards consisted of a solid set re-planting or an orchard with a mixture of mature and reset-replacement trees. Psyllid abundance was measured on the edges of five orchards. The factor investigated was the presence or absence of a windbreak. We observed significantly fewer psyllids on the edges of orchards with windbreaks as compared to those without windbreaks. We found no significant difference in the number of natural enemies between the edges with or without windbreaks, suggesting that windbreaks do not affect densities of psyllid natural enemies. Also, during two consecutive years, we compared the densities of psyllids on young trees less than 3 years of age in a solid set re-planting versus on resets (trees planted in replacement of dead or huanglongbing-infected trees) present randomly within mature orchards. This was conducted in four orchards and among three citrus varieties. More psyllids were found in the solid set re-plantings as compared with on the resets within mature orchards. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that the planting strategy of new trees in orchards may impact the populations of a horticultural pest. Overall our data suggest that establishment and conservation of windbreaks might be beneficial to protect orchards from D. citri. The data also suggest that D. citri populations increase more within uniform landscapes of seedling trees as compared with mature orchards with randomly interspersed young seedlings.},

Distribution and phenology of the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri (Kuwayama), the vector of CLas, was investigated over a 2-year sampling period in north Florida. Diaphorina citri was only found in backyard and ornamental citrus along the Gulf of Mexico, and was not observed in cultivated citrus groves during the 2 years (2017-2018) of the survey. Diaphorina citri population peaks occurred approximately 2 mo later than in central Florida with major population peaks occurring in July. The number of D. citri adults was significantly higher on CLas infected than uninfected citrus trees, whereas more nymphs were found on uninfected trees. Most D. citri were negative for CLas except in Franklin county where both infected trees and psyllids were found. We were able to find adult D. citri during all winter months, despite temperatures as low as -5.5°C. During two consecutive winters, we conducted experiments to determine D. citri cold hardiness by caging D. citri under ambient conditions in mid-November and assessing survivors in the following spring. In 2018, approximately 21\%, of D. citri adults survived overwintering whereas 16\% survived in 2019 despite lower temperature in 2018 than in 2019. As we are at the earliest stage of HLB infestation, management of D. citri and CLas in north Florida should focus on removal of CLas-infected trees to reduce the reservoir of pathogen.}

Species identification of these mites is difficult because of their small size and morphological similarities. The objective of this study was to develop an accurate and rapid molecular fingerprinting method for identifying B. phoenicis and B. californicus on Texas citrus. Iso-colonies of the two Brevipalpus species were cultured on immature citrus fruit and identified using a dichotomous key. Whole genome amplification was used to produce DNA template from single mites to identify the two species by amplified fragment length polymorphism and sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR). Population dynamics of Brevipalpus were monitored in four citrus orchards during the 2007 growing season. Subsamples of mites were identified morphologically or by species-specific SCAR markers. Molecular fingerprinting was very efficient in identifying the two species of mites in subsamples, even in cases where the morphological identification did not discriminate between species. Brevipalpus spp. density per fruit was significantly affected by the host plant species, with sweet orange fruit hosting significantly higher density than grapefruit, Citrus x paradisi Macfad. The percentage of fruit infested with Brevipalpus mites varied significantly with time but not with host plant and the host plant by sampling date interaction. Comparison of molecular fingerprinting and morphological identification provided a high percentage of match ¿85\% between the two methods, suggesting that molecular fingerprinting could facilitate studies on population dynamics of Brevipalpus in citrus.},

  abstract = {Spatial distribution and flight and predation activities of Coenosia attenuata Stein (Diptera Muscidae) adults were studied in greenhouse vegetable crops in the Oeste region, Portugal. During spring and summer, fewer flies were seen in the crops in the middle of the day in relation to the morning and afternoon periods. Males/ females ratio was 1:4, independently of the season. Flies were significantly more abundant in the sunny areas of crops in relation to the shadowed ones, and were found landed on cucumber and sweet pepper plants (especially on leaves), in opposition to tomato plants; in this crop, flies preferred the tutors and other greenhouse structures. Adults were also abundant next to the soil, on the plastic covering it and on irrigation pipes. Outside greenhouses, adults were landed everywhere. Most flies, when landed in the pending cucumber leaves, were next to their borders and oriented downwards. Some flights were trigged by insects flying inside a range of about 30 cm distance (here called “provoked flights”), and also by other movements made by the observer nearby. Insects landed on the same leaf as the predator, moving closely (but not flying), were not attacked. The majority of flights registered had no visible cause (“non-provoked flights”), some of them looking more like jumps. In 72\% of provoked flights, flies returned to the leaf they had just left, and in almost half of them, they adopted both the location and the orientation they had before in the leaf. The percentage of preys captured was very low: many flights were probably the result of a territorial behaviour and not of a predation activity. Cannibalism was not detected in the field. Predation in the field occurred on whiteflies, small hymenopterans, leafhoppers, leafminers, sciarids, psocopterans, and also on thrips. Most preys were attacked in the cervix area.},

One linear and seven nonlinear regression functions were fit to egg-to-adult development rate data to characterize thermal performance curves. Temperature fluctuations significantly affected both development and longevity of T. radiata. Estimates of degree-days predicted by the linear model were 30\% higher for the fluctuating regime than the constant regime. Nonlinear model estimations of theoretical minimum and maximum developmental thresholds were lower for the fluctuating regime when compared to the constant regime. These predictions align with experimental observations. Parasitoids reared under fluctuating profiles at low average temperatures developed faster (15°C) and survived longer (15–20°C) when compared to those reared under constant regimes with corresponding means. In contrast, high average fluctuating temperatures produced parasitoids with an extended developmental period (35°C) and reduced longevity (30–35°C). A meta-analysis of published T. radiata development datasets, together with the results of this study, indicated convergence in degree-days and theoretical minimum developmental thresholds among geographically distinct parasitoid populations. These findings demonstrate the significant effects of temperature on T. radiata life history and have important implications for optimization of mass-rearing and release efforts, improvement of predictions from climate modeling, and comparison of T. radiata population performance across climatic gradients and geographic regions.},

Seasonal fluctuations in CRM population density were similar from year to year but differed between treatments. From early May to mid-July, mite population densities were always lower on copper-treated leaves compared to the untreated controls. According to laboratory studies, the lower CRM population density in copper treatments was affected by reduced fecundity rather than increased adult mortality or reduced egg eclosion. Epizootics of H. thompsonii occurred in the unsprayed control in July both years. The incidence of fungal pathogen in mite populations was density-dependent and was affected by the time of copper treatment. Copper sprays applied before, during or after mite populations peaked in summer did not prevent but influenced the magnitude of the epizootic by causing a reduction in both CRM populations and the incidence of infected mites.

The T. radiata (Taiwan) population showed the greatest moisture requirement at all temperatures and relative humidities tested.

Sweetpotato weevil is a major pest of sweetpotato in most areas of cultivation, the feeding of which induces production in the sweetpotato root of extremely bitter tasting and toxic sesquiterpenes which can render the sweetpotato unfit for consumption. A significant step towards improved management of this weevil species was the identification of a female-produced sex pheromone [(Z)-3-dodecenyl (E)-2-butenoate] to which males are highly attracted. Reported here are results of research that documents a nearly 5-fold increase in male sweetpotato weevil catch in traps baited with this pheromone and a green light provided by a solar-powered, light-emitting diode (LED). The combination of olfactory and night-visible visual cues significantly enhanced trap effectiveness for this nighttime-active insect species. These results provide promise for improved sweetpotato weevil detection and suppression in mass trapping programs.},

After this period, the females and the excess eggs were removed, leaving only one egg of B. phoencis on each arena. The arenas were examined daily, evaluating the mite survival and the number of eggs laid. Fertility life table was prepared using the data obtained. B. phoenicis mites presented significant differences in survivorship and population growth rates, when reared on different coffee cultivars. The most favorable cultivars for the multiplication of B. phoenicis were, in this sequence: Apoatã, Mundo Novo and Obatã, based on the finite rates of increase. Icatu Vermelho proved to be the least favorable cultivar for the multiplication of B. phoenicis.}

  abstract = {Simple Summary The role of plant diversity near greenhouses is heavily debated because it may have both negative and positive effects on pest control inside greenhouses. In this review, we discuss these potential risks and benefits. Although there is the risk of an increased influx of some pests and of viruses transmitted by pests, we argue that biodiversity in the adjacent environment usually has limited effects on pest abundance in greenhouses in temperate climates, as most greenhouse pests in temperate climates are of exotic origin. The main benefit of increased biodiversity near greenhouses is the immigration of natural enemies that can suppress pests inside greenhouses. An open question is how this can be promoted by specific plant communities, plant characteristics, and habitats while minimising risks. Plant biodiversity inside greenhouses can also support biological control. We summarise general methods that growers can use to enhance pest control with functional biodiversity and suggest that it is particularly important to study how biodiversity inside and outside greenhouses can be linked to enhancement of biological pest control with both released and naturally occurring species of natural enemies. Abstract One of the ecosystem services of biodiversity is the contribution to pest control through conservation and stimulation of natural enemies. However, whether plant diversity around greenhouses is beneficial or a potential risk is heavily debated. In this review, we argue that most greenhouse pests in temperate climates are of exotic origin and infest greenhouses mainly through transportation of plant material. For indigenous pests, we discuss the potential ways in which plant diversity around greenhouses can facilitate or prevent pest migrations into greenhouses. As shown in several studies, an important benefit of increased plant diversity around greenhouses is the stimulation of indigenous natural enemies that migrate to greenhouses, where they suppress both indigenous and exotic pests. How this influx can be supported by specific plant communities, plant characteristics, and habitats while minimising risks of increasing greenhouse pest densities, virus transmission, or hyperparasitism needs further studies. It also requires a better understanding of the underlying processes that link biodiversity with pest management. Inside greenhouses, plant biodiversity can also support biological control. We summarise general methods that growers can use to enhance pest control with functional biodiversity and suggest that it is particularly important to study how biodiversity inside and outside greenhouses can be linked to enhancement of biological pest control with both released and naturally occurring species of natural enemies},

Feeding by D. citri nymphs often resulted in the abscission of leaves and even whole shoots. Shoot elongation was abated when death of the apical meristem occurred. Key predators of nymphal psyllids were the coccinellid beetles Harmonia axyridis Pallas, Olla v-nigrum Mulsant, Cycloneda sanguinea L., and Exochomus childreni Mulsant. Two lacewings, Ceraeochrysa sp. and Chrysoperla rufilabris Burmeister, a spider, Hibana velox (Becker), and the introduced parasitoid Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) contributed additional mortality. Exclusion of primary predators from infested terminals with field cages doubled the duration of psyllid infestation, improved parasitoid survival by 40-fold, and improved psyllid maturation success (first instar to adult) by 120-fold. The results indicate that coccinellid beetles are the most important biological control agents of high-density D. citri populations in central Florida and that intraguild predation causes {$>$}95\% mortality of immature stages of T. radiata.},

Abstract The effects of climate and ants on population regulation of an invasive citrus pest, Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Liviidae), by its parasitoid Tamarixia radiata (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), in southern California were examined over a four-year period. Densities of D. citri eggs, nymphs, and adults, and Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), a mutualist which defends psyllid nymphs from natural enemies, citrus flush growth patterns, and parasitism rates of T. radiata, were monitored every four weeks on grapefruit, lemon, lime, orange, and tangerine trees at 28 urban sites across three climate types (coastal, intermediate, and desert). Significant spatial and temporal effects on D. citri abundance and parasitism rates were observed over this four-year period. Highest D. citri densities and parasitism rates were found in the intermediate and coastal regions during peaks of flushing cycles of citrus plants over March-June and September-November each year. Over the course of this study, population densities of D. citri declined by over 75\%. Parasitism by T. radiata was identified as a significant mortality factor often exceeding 60\% during periods of peak parasitoid activity. Analyses indicated that parasitism resulted in delayed density-dependent mortality and subsequent reductions in D. citri densities lagged by   1 yr. Trends in D. citri densities and parasitism rates over time were similar on grapefruit, lemons, limes, oranges, and tangerines. Presence of L. humile in citrus resulted in a 3-fold increase in D. citri densities and control of this pest ant is needed to maximize biological control of D. citri.},

Tydeids were also evaluated because of the high frequency of these mites on coffee plants. Samples of leaves, branches and fruits were taken fortnightly, from April 2001 to June 2003, from plants randomly chosen in the coffee plantation. B. phoenicis mites were found on leaves in higher number during the drier periods of the year. Among the predaceous mites, Euseius citrifolius Denmark \& Muma and Euseius concordis (Chant) were the most frequent species on the surface of leaves. During the evaluations, 72,534 domatia were cut and opened to remove the mites, from 6,360 leaves examined. Zetzellia malvinae Matioli, Ueckermann \& Oliveira was the most frequent predator species found inside domatia. Significant correlations were observed between population dynamics of, among others, E. concordis and B. phoenicis, Z. malvinae and B. phoenicis, and Z. malvinae and E. concordis. Significant correlations were also verified between the number of domatia and the population densities of B. phoenicis, E. concordis, Lorryia sp. and Z. malvinae. Interactions between predator–prey and predator–predator on coffee plants are discussed. The influence of the meteorological factors temperature and precipitation on the most frequent mite species is also discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative methods that have the potential to reduce the entry of Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), the major citrus pest worldwide, into commercial groves could be a viable approach for huanglongbing management. Kaolin is an aluminum silicate that when sprayed on plants forms a white particle film that interferes with host recognition by the insects. Diaphorina citri orients towards the host plants by visual and olfactory cues. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of processed kaolin on D. citri settling (no-choice) and probing behavior [electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique] under laboratory conditions, and to study its host plant finding ability and dispersal under field conditions in the absence and presence of young shoots. RESULTS: Under laboratory conditions, kaolin caused an overall reduction of 40\% in the number of psyllids settled on treated seedlings; furthermore, the proportion of individuals that were able to reach the phloem was 50\% lower on kaolin-treated plants than on untreated plants. In the field, the plant finding ability of D. citri was disrupted on kaolin-treated trees (overall reduction of 96\%), regardless of the vegetative condition, and psyllid dispersal was slower in kaolin-treated plots than in the untreated control. CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrates that processed kaolin interferes negatively with different aspects of the host plant finding ability of D. citri. These findings suggest that processed kaolin has a high potential to reduce huanglongbing primary infection.},

  abstract = {During their long, approximately 350 million-year period of coexistence, plants, insects, and other arthropods evolved a variety of different interactions (Gatehouse, 2002). Some interactions can be beneficial for the plant, as in the case of insect-mediated pollination or seed dispersion, and others are deleterious, as in the case of attack by herbivorous insects (Fig. 1). To successfully combat aggressors, plants must be equipped with a sophisticated sensory system to perceive signals fast and efficiently from their environment and thereby detect potential enemies and subsequently translate and integrate such signals into appropriate biochemical and physiological responses. Thus, upon attack, a number of reactions are detectable in plant cells, including changes in ion flux and protein phosphorylation, formation of reactive oxygen species and oxylipins, as well as initiation of various defense reactions in the host plant (Kessler and Baldwin, 2002; Maffei et al., 2007b). Intriguing questions arising from these observations are how plants recognize the particular herbivores, what kinds of signals are involved, how such signals are perceived, and how they are converted into downstream signaling pathways involved in plant defense activation. Signal perception in the plant cell may rely on the presence of specific receptors for chemical signals or on general recognition processes based on localized tissue injuries. In principle, the feeding process combines two sites of the same coin: mechanical wounding of the infested tissue and introduction of oral secretions that are delivered from the feeding organism into the wounded tissue (i.e. the attacked plant is challenged by both a mechanical as well as a chemical stimulus). This Update introduces herbivore-derived metabolites, which represent serious candidates for signaling compounds; we will also discuss advances in herbivore recognition, namely, the perception of insect-derived signals by specific binding proteins. The properties of these binding proteins suggest their involvement in signal perception.},

  abstract = {The eriophyid mite Phyllocoptes fructiphilus Keifer (Acari: Eriophyidae) transmits rose rosette virus to rose (Rosa spp.; Rosaceae) while feeding, which causes serious disease referred to as rose rosette disease. Although there is no cure once rose plants are infected with rose rosette virus, understanding the response of P. fructiphilus and rose rosette disease to abiotic factors such as relative humidity may help to develop management strategies for the disease. The major objective of the current study was to determine the effect of relative humidity on the abundance of P. fructiphilus, as well as the incidence and severity of rose rosette disease symptoms. An experiment was conducted in environmentally controlled chambers where potted pink double knock-out rose plants were maintained at 20, 60, and 95\% relative humidity after introducing about 20 P. fructiphilus individuals by attaching a 7-cm-long, field-collected terminal to the branches of potted plants. The densities of P. fructiphilus were recorded at biweekly intervals for 12 wk. The proportion of terminals with rose rosette disease symptoms (disease incidence) and severity of rose rosette disease symptoms was assessed using the Horsfall-Barratt scale at biweekly intervals for 14 wk. The results show that the number of P. fructiphilus individuals was significantly greater under a moderate 60\% relative humidity than under a high (95\%) or low (20\%) relative humidity (P 0.05). However, the incidence and severity of rose rosette disease symptoms were significantly higher under 95\% relative humidity relative humidity regimen than under 20\% relative humidity regimen (P 0.05). The implications of these results on the breeding program and management of P. fructiphilus and the incidence of rose rosette disease are discussed.},

  abstract = {A cultura de citros é uma das mais importantes no Brasil para consumo a nível nacional, e como uma fonte de divisa para o pais, principalmente através das exportações de suco concentrado. Ao redor do mundo, esta cultura é atacada por diferentes organismos, alguns dos quais frequentemente atingem a condição de pragas de considerável importância. Dado o valor econômico desta cultura a nível nacional e internacional, o agricultor é frequentemente levado a se "defender", muitas vezes de uma forma preventiva, contra os fatores que poderíam resultar em perdas significativas de produtividade. Esta preocupação frequentemente conduz ao uso exagerado de produtos químicos, que por sua vez pode gerar outros problemas importantes, desencadeados por desbalances ecológicos devidos à mortandade de inimigos naturais de pragas. Dentre os diversos artrópodos que atacam os citros no Brasil, deve-se destacar a presença de ácaros fitófagos, que podem atingir níveis consideráveis em diferentes épocas do ano. Folhas e frutos de citros frequentemente abrigam espécies de ácaros pertencentes a diferentes famílias. Porém, nem todos estes organismos se constituem em pragas, e alguns deles na realidade podem ser benéficos, por se alimentarem dos ácaros fitófagos, ou por servirem de alimento alternativo a ácaros predadores.

  abstract = {Plants respond to insect herbivory by synthesizing and releasing complex blends of volatile compounds, which provide important host-location cues for insects that are natural enemies of herbivores1,2,3. The effects of these volatile blends on herbivore behaviour have been investigated to only a limited extent4,5, in part because of the assumption that herbivore-induced volatile emissions occur mainly during the light phase of the photoperiod6,7. Because many moths—whose larvae are some of the most important insect herbivores—are nocturnal, herbivore-induced plant volatiles have not hitherto been considered to be temporally available as host-location cues for ovipositing females. Here we present chemical and behavioural assays showing that tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum) release herbivore-induced volatiles during both night and day. Moreover, several volatile compounds are released exclusively at night and are highly repellent to female moths (Heliothis virescens). The demonstration that tobacco plants release temporally different volatile blends and that lepidopteran herbivores use induced plant signals released during the dark phase to choose sites for oviposition adds a new dimension to our understanding of the role of chemical cues in mediating tritrophic interactions.},

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, vectors the causal organism of citrus greening disease. Control approaches involving entomopathogenic fungi may be useful on ornamental and abandoned citrus and other rutaceous hosts, which could act as vector and pathogen reservoirs. A Texas isolate of the fungus Isaria fumosorosea (Ifr) caused 95\% mortality in applications to D. citri. In laboratory bioassays at 27 °C, 70\% of psyllids died within one week when exposed to yellow cards that had been sprayed with liquid blastospore suspension. A potentially more practical approach of coating cards with filtered dry powder containing blastospores and emulsified wax adhesive did not cause significant mortality, but efficacy was 35\% higher when the adhesive contained a blend of stimulatory citrus volatiles than on cards with no volatiles. Under greenhouse conditions (25 to 37°C), yellow cards with Ifr as either dried liquid suspension or powder were hung in cages containing psyllids. Mortality was low ({$<$} 40\%) in all tests, but the inclusion of citrus volatiles increased mortality by 23\%. Psyllids caged with blastospore powder-coated cards for one week did not transfer inoculum horizontally to other adults or vertically to offspring. However, when psyllids were exposed to these cards for 24 hours in a Petri dish and then released into cages containing unexposed psyllids, 25\% of those psyllids died within three weeks. The results provide insight into chemical stimuli and physical fungal exposure conditions associated with an autodissemination device to aid in control of D. citri.},

Eggs and nymphs were reared at temperatures of 15.0 to 32.5°C at an interval of 2.5°C with 16L : 8D on shoots of orange jasmine, Murraya exotica L. Nymphs at 15.0°C fail to develop to adults, and the mortality of those at 32.5°C increased. The incubation period decreased at higher temperatures, varying 15.0 to 2.5 d. These nymphs became adults in 36.3 d at 15.0°C and in 10.7 d at 30°C, but 16.8 d at 32.5°C. The developmental zero and effective accumulative temperatures were 13.66°C and 46.93 d-degrees in the egg group, 11.56°C and 192.27 d-degrees in the nymph group, respectively. Based on these results and winter temperatures, the northern limit of nymphal overwintering of the psyllid in Japan was predicted: the northern limit may be off the southern shores of Kyushu Island, southern Japan, and ca. 31°N.},

Resistance against scab (pathogen: Cladosporium cucumerinum) and the accumulation of chitinase were rapidly induced in cucumber plants after treatment with acibenzolar-S-methyl. In contrast, SA protected the plants from C. cucumerinum and the accumulation of chitinase was induced only on the treated leaves. The accumulation of chitinase in response to inoculation with the pathogen was induced more rapidly in cucumber plants previously treated with acibenzolar-S-methyl than in plants pretreated with SA or water. Thus, it appears that a prospective signal(s), that induces systemic resistance, can be transferred from leaves treated with acibenzolar-S-methyl to the untreated upper and lower leaves where systemic resistance is elicited. In contrast, exogenously applied SA is not likely to function as a mobile, systemic resistance-inducing signal, because SA only induces localized acquired resistance.},

Citrus limonia (Rangpur lime), Murraya paniculata (orange jessamine) and Citrus sunki (Sunki mandarin) were used as hosts. Measurements included duration and viability of the egg and nymphal stages, sex ratio, fecundity and longevity. In order to verify the effect of temperature on D. citri biology, the duration and viability of its developmental stages and biological cycle were compared at seven different temperature conditions. Durations of the embryonic and nymphal stages were similar for Rangpur lime, orange jessamine and mandarin. However, the nymphal viability obtained on mandarin was lower than the values obtained on the other hosts. Fecundity was higher on orange jessamine and, in all instances, females had greater longevity than males. A fixed number of instars (five) was obtained on the three hosts. Rangpur lime and orange jessamine provided better D. citri development when compared with mandarin. Duration of the egg and nymphal stages varied from 2.6 to 7.7 and from 9.4 to 35.8 days, respectively, at temperatures from 18 to 32°C. Egg viability was higher than 81.6\% at the temperature range studied (18–32°C); nymphal viability was higher than 70\% at the 18–30°C range, differing from viability at 32°C, which was dramatically reduced. The D. citri lower temperature development threshold (TT) and thermal constant (K) values for the egg, nymphal and biological cycle (egg–adult) stages were 12.0°C and 52.6 Degree-Day (DD); 13.9°C and 156.9 DD; and 13.5°C and 210.9 DD respectively.}

The insects were reared in climatic chambers at constant temperatures of 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, and 32 ± 1°C, 70 ± 10\% RH, and a 14 h photophase. Host plants for D. citri included orange (Citrus sinensis [Rutaceae]) varieties Pêra and Natal, the rootstock, Rungpur lime (C. limonia [Rutaceae]) and the natural host, Orange jessamine (Murraya paniculata [Rutaceae]). To study the influence of geographic origin on thermal requirements, we studied D. citri populations from Piracicaba, SP (warmer region) and Itapetininga, SP (cooler region). The duration and survival of the development stages and the duration of the total development (egg-adult) did not differ significantly on the different hosts, but it did vary with temperature. Nymphs of D. citri created on the different hosts have the same thermal requirements. The thermal requirements for this species collected from the two climate regions were identical; males and females also had the same thermal requirements.},

We conducted four diagnostic surveys—three in Southern Benin and one along the coast of Tanzania—to determine the distribution of A. guerreronis and the severity of its damage to coconut fruits, as well as the diversity and abundance of other associated mites and potential natural enemies. Aceria guerreronis was found in all visited plantations with the percentage of damaged fruits varying considerably among plantations—67–85\% in Benin and 43–81\% in Tanzania. Overall, 30–40\% of the fruit surfaces were damaged by A. guerreronis. Damage severity increased with fruit age and negatively affected fruit weight of 7- to 12-months-old fruits. Aceria guerreronis was by far the most abundant mite on coconut fruits but its abundance depended on fruit age. The highest densities of A. guerreronis were observed on 3- to 4-months-old fruits. Neocypholaelaps sp. (Ameroseiidae) was the most abundant mite on inflorescences. Three species of predatory mites (Phytoseiidae)—Neoseiulus baraki, N. neobaraki and N. paspalivorus—were the most commonly found predatory mites beneath the coconut bracts in association with A. guerreronis. Neoseiulus neobaraki was the prevailing predator in Tanzania while N. paspalivorus was the most frequent predator in Benin. Other mites found beneath the bracts were the herbivore Steneotarsonemus furcatus (Tarsonemidae) and the detritivore and fungivore Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Acaridae).},

Development, reproduction and predation capacity of the predatory mites were assessed in the first (G1) and sixth generation (G6) of rearing on the different diets. Immature survival rates in G1 were similar on all diets (96.8–100 \%). After six generations, however, survival of A. swirskii was significantly reduced on all diets except on A. franciscana cysts. Oviposition rates did not differ between generations when females were fed on E. kuehniella, AD2 or AD3. The total number of deposited eggs was similar among diets except in G6 where the females fed on A. franciscana cysts produced more eggs than those maintained on E. kuehniella eggs. On most diets the intrinsic rates of increase in G1 were superior to those in G6, except for predators supplied with A. franciscana cysts where no differences were observed among generations. Female mites did not lose their capacity to kill first instar Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) after six generations on the different diets, but predation rates in G6 on E. kuehniella were lower than in G1. In conclusion, the different factitious and artificial diets tested in the present study supported the development and reproduction of A. swirskii for a single generation but fitness losses occurred to a varying degree after several generations on E. kuehniella eggs or the artificial diets. Artificial diet enriched with A. franciscana cysts yielded better results than the other artificial diets. Amblyseius swirskii performed best on decapsulated Artemia cysts indicating their potential for use in the mass production of the predator or to sustain its populations in the crop after release.},

  abstract = {The title of this article implies that we will detail the repellents and attractants for Diaprepes root weevil. In fact, for repellents nothing is known about materials repellent to Diaprepes, and information on attractants is preliminary and, in some cases, confusing. Before we discuss Diaprepes root weevil in the insect family Curculionidae, we will discuss the Diabrotica beetles which belong to the family Chrysomelidae or leaf beetle family. The Diabrotica is a very destructive neotropical genus which includes spotted cucumber beetle Diabrotica u. howardi, banded cucumber beetle D. balteata, cucurbit beetle D. speciosa, and so forth. The Diabrotica beetles apparently have co-evolved with the Cucurbitaceae plant family. This is the gourd, squash, cucumber and melon family and contains about 900 species. The Diabrotica insect genus consists of about 338 species. About 300 of these, the fucata group, are confined to South and Central America. About 35 species (the virgifera group) are found in North America. The fucata group feeds on many plant species as adults and larvae, has many generations per year and overwinters as adults in the southern United States. The virgifera group has one generation per year and overwinters as a diapausing egg. The adults feed on pollen. Some of the virgifera group, such as the northern corn rootworm and western corn rootworm, are very damaging to corn. The plants in the Cucurbitaceae family produce cucurbitacins. These nonvolatile, high molecular weight compounds are found in all cucurbit plant parts except the seed. Cucurbitacins are extremely bitter to humans, but for the Diabrotica beetles, cucurbitacins are feeding stimulants. Diabrotica beetles will feed on all sorts of nonfood items as long as they contain cucurbitacins. The beetles metabolize ingested cucurbitacins to 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin D and store this compound. Mammals, on the other hand, perceive cucurbitacins and their derivatives as some of the bitterest substances known. Cucurbitacins are more toxic to mice than most of our registered agricultural pesticides. Cucurbitacins are also feeding deterrents for many other insect species. So it appears that cucurbitacins are protective against herbivores. The Diabrotica beetles do not randomly select plants to taste. They are attracted to Cucurbitaceae blossom volatiles. These volatiles have been isolated and identified, and mixtures of blossom chemicals serve as attractants for various Diabrotica beetles. Some of these mixtures can attract specific species (Metcalf and Metcalf, 1992). Some plant chemicals are termed kairomones and come in three varieties: attractants, arrestants and excitants. The Diabrotica beetle story is perhaps the best documented kairomone system in the insect world. The blossom volatiles of Cucurbitaceae serve as attractants and the cucurbitacins serve as arrestants and excitants. Compare their story with the attractant research on Diaprepes root weevil which follows.},

  abstract = {We investigated the searching behaviour of two species of predatory mites, Typhlodromips swirskii (Athias-Henriot) and Euseius scutalis (Athias-Henriot), both known to feed on immature stages of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci Gennadius. When released in a greenhouse inside a circle of cucumber plants that were alternatingly clean or infested with immature whiteflies, the mites took several days to find plants. Both species were recaptured significantly more on plants with whiteflies. This suggests that the mites are able to discriminate between plants with and without whiteflies. The predators may either have been attracted to plants with whiteflies from a distance or arrested on plants with whiteflies. Typhlodromips swirskii that had previously fed on whitefly immatures on cucumber leaves were significantly attracted by volatiles from cucumber plants with whiteflies in a Y-tube olfactometer. This suggests that the mites use volatile cues to discriminate between infested and clean plants. However, this response waned rapidly; if predators, experienced as above, were starved for 3–4 h in absence of cucumber leaves, they no longer preferred volatiles of infested plants to clean plants. Furthermore, T. swirskii that had no experience with immature whiteflies on cucumber plants also did not prefer odours of infested plants to those of clean plants. Because the release experiment with this species in the greenhouse was done with inexperienced predators, this suggests that the aggregation of mites on plants with whiteflies was mainly caused by differential arrestment of mites on plants with prey and clean plants. For T. swirskii, this was in agreement with the finding that the fraction of predators on plants with prey increased with time to levels higher than 70\%. A less clear trend was found for E. scutalis, for which the fraction of predators on plants with prey stabilized soon after release to levels from 54–70\%. Hence, the predatory mites may find plants with prey by random searching, but they are subsequently arrested on these plants. An earlier study showed that 87\% of all whiteflies released in a set-up as used here were recaptured within 1 day. Hence, the effectiveness with which predatory mites locate plants with whiteflies is low compared with that of their prey. We expect this to generate spatial patterns in the dynamics of predator and prey and this may have consequences for biological control of whiteflies with predatory mites.},

  abstract = {Citrus leprosis (CL) is one of the most important viral diseases in sweet orange orchards in Latin America. It is caused by members of at least five species of the so-called Brevipalpus-transmitted viruses (BTV), and the prevalent is Citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C). This virus has the broadest host range amongst all CL-associated viruses and is transmitted by Brevipalpus yothersi, a polyphagous mite that can colonize a large variety of host plants, including some spontaneous ground cover plants. But if, on one hand, spontaneous plants can host CL virus and vector, on the other hand, they can offer alternative food for predators, equally common in organic citrus orchards. Brevipalpus yothersi and predator mites were surveyed in 33 spontaneous plants of a Westin sweet orange orchard conducted under organic production system in Brazil, from June 2010 to April 2011. Predatory mites were identified as phytoseiids, and Iphiseiodes zuluagai was the prevalent species, representing 58\% of all predators. Other phytoseiids were considered accidental species in the area. Ageratum conyzoides and Alternanthera tenella were the most represented plant host species to predators, comprising 28 and 10\% of the total surveyed plants, respectively. Brevipalpus yothersi specimens were detected on various spontaneous species: A. conyzoides, A. tenella, Amaranthus deflexus, Bidens pilosa, Ipomoea quamoclit, I. cairica, Merremia cissoides, Solanum americanum, Panicum maximum, and, predominantly, Commelina benghalensis. The latter has been previously reported as host of CiLV-C as well and, therefore, it is recommended to eliminate this species from citrus orchards.},

  abstract = {Mesh exclusion bags are increasingly being adopted by Florida citrus growers to protect young citrus trees from Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, and Huanglongbing disease. These mesh bags exclude larger insects such as D. citri but may allow entry of minute insects. Hibiscus mealybugs, Nipaecoccus viridis (Newstead), have been observed thriving in the micro-habitat created by these covers on trees. Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) and insect growth regulators (IGRs) are effective against several mealybug species under various growing conditions, but their efficacy against N. viridis or within the microclimate within exclusion bags is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated various formulations of entomopathogenic fungi with and without IGR against N. viridis using laboratory bioassays. We then conducted semifield bioassays to determine effectiveness of EPF formulations alone and in combination with an IGR applied to citrus trees enveloped within mesh bags under field conditions. Survival probabilities of N. viridis nymphs exposed to all Beauveria bassiana-based products tested were comparable to malathion under laboratory conditions and reduced survival as compared to controls (water only). Under field conditions, mortality of N. viridis nymphs on leaves sprayed with each fungal formulation tested was significantly greater than on control treatments (Water, Suffoil X, 435 oil) up to four weeks post application. There were no differences in the colony forming units per leaf area amongst all fungal treatments. Formulated B. bassiana-based products applied alone or combined with an IGR should be effective tools for managing N. viridis populations on young citrus trees protected with mesh exclusion bags.},

  abstract = {SYNOPSIS. Parthenogenesis is discussed according to type (arrhenotoky, thelytoky, deuteroLoky, artificial parthenogenesis, gynogenesis) and presence in various acarine taxa. Evidence for parthenogenesis is based on rearing and/or cytological studies. Arrhenotoky occurs in Mesostigmata, Prostigmata and Astigmata and usually does not occur sporadically throughout these taxa; when present it operates in many closely related species as the major type of reproduction in certain genera, subfamilies or families. Thelytoky is present in Mesostigmata, Metastigmata, Prostigmata, Astigmata and Cryptostigmata, but in no case is the major mode of reproduction in higher taxa, i.e. subfamilies, families. Its sporadic occurrence may or may not be accompanied by polyploidy. Deuterotoky occurs in one acarine group (Listrophoridae) and artificial parthenogenesis is possible in ticks (Metastigmata). Gynogenesis is present in several species of haplo-diploid Mesostigmata (some Dermanyssidae, Phytoseiidae), although it is usually considered in connection with thelytoky. Current studies of the effects of ploidy level on morphological variation indicate greater character variability in diploid females than in haploid males. In some species of ticks thelytoky is expressed differentially even on an intraspecific level. One geographic strain of a species may have the ability to reproduce thelytokously, but if mated produces males and females.},

In this study, a virus infecting H. rosa-sinensis plants displaying foliar symptoms consistent with infection by a kitavirus, including yellow chlorotic blotches with a green perimeter, was characterized. The genome consisted of two RNAs 8.4 and 4.4 kb in length, and was organized most similarly to cileviruses, but with important distinctions. These included the location of the p29 homolog as the 3\$\textbackslash prime\$-terminal open reading frame (ORF) of RNA2 instead of its typical locus at the 3\$\textbackslash prime\$-end of RNA1; the absence of a p15 homolog on RNA2 and the adjacent intergenic region which also harbors small putative ORFs of unknown function; and the presence of an ORF encoding a 10 kDa protein at the 3\$\textbackslash prime\$-terminal end of RNA1 that was also found to be present in the hibiscus green spot virus 2 genome. Spherical particles approximately 55–65 nm in diameter were observed in infected leaf tissue, and viral RNA was detected by reverse-transcription PCR in individual mites collected from symptomatic plants tentatively identified as Brevipalpus yothersi. Although phylogenetic analyses placed this virus between the higrevirus and cilevirus clades, we propose the tentative taxonomic placement of this virus, designated hibiscus yellow blotch virus (HYBV), within the genus Cilevirus.},

  abstract = {Citrus leprosis is an economically important disease of citrus in South and Central America. The disease can be caused by several non-systemic viruses belonging to the genera Cilevirus (family Kitaviridae) and Dichorhavirus (family Rhabdoviridae) (Roy et al. 2015; Freitas-Astúa et al. 2018). In February 2020, lesions consistent with citrus leprosis were observed on the leaves and stems of rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri) and mandarin (C. reticulata) trees in Hilo, Hawaii. Brevipalpus mites, vector of orchid fleck virus (OFV), were also present on these trees (Freitas-Astúa et al. 2018). To identify the virus associated with the symptoms, total RNA was isolated using a NucleoSpin RNA Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel) and underwent reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with two newly designed universal primers specific for dichorhaviruses (Dichora-R1-F1: 5`-CAYCACTGYGCBRTNGCWGATGA, Dichora-R1-R1: 5`-AGKATRTSWGCCATCCKGGCTATBAG). The expected 350 bp amplicon was obtained and directly sequenced in both directions. Blastn and Blastx searches revealed that the primer-trimmed consensus sequence (MT232917) shared 99.3\% nucleotide (nt) and 100\% amino acid (aa) identity with an OFV isolate from Germany (AF321775). OFV has two orchid- (OFV-Orc1 and OFV-Orc2) and two citrus- (OFV-Cit1 and OFV-Cit2) infecting strains (Roy et al. 2020). However, an isolate of OFV-Orc1 has recently been associated with citrus leprosis in South Africa (Cook et al. 2019). To confirm the presence of OFV in Hawaiian citrus and identify the strain, symptomatic tissue was submitted to USDA-APHIS-PPQ-S\&T where total RNA were extracted from the symptomatic tissue using RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen). The RNA samples were tested with OFV-Orc and OFV-Cit generic and specific primers in a conventional RT-PCR assay following optimized RT-PCR protocols (Roy et al. 2020). Two additional sets of generic primers (OFV-Orc-GPF: 5'-AGCGATAACGACCTTGATATGACACC, OFV-Orc-GPR: 5'-TGAGTGGTAGTCAATG CTCCATCAT and OFV-R2-GF1: 5'- CARTGTCAGGAGGATGCATGGAA, OFV-R2-GR: 5'- GACCTGCTTGATGTAATTGCTTCCTTC') were designed based on available OFV phospho (P) and large (L) polyprotein gene sequences in GenBank. These assays detected OFV-Orc2 in the symptomatic citrus samples, with the nucleocapsid (1353 bp), P (626 bp), and L (831 bp) gene sequences sharing 97 to 98\% identity with published OFV-Orc2 sequences (AB244417 and AB516441). Ribo-depleted RNA (Ribo-Zero, Illumina) was prepared using a TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep kit (Illumina) and underwent high throughput sequencing (HTS) on a MiSeq platform (Illumina). The resulting 19.6 million 2x75bp reads were de novo assembled using SPAdes v. 3.10.0 (Bankevitch et al. 2012). In addition to sequences corresponding to citrus tristeza virus and citrus vein enation virus, two contigs of 6,412 nt (average depth 18,821; MW021482) and 5,986 nt (average depth 19,278; MW021483), were found to have \$\textbackslash geq\$98\% identity to RNA1 (AB244417) and RNA2 (AB244418) of OFV isolate So (Japan), respectively. This is the first report of OFV in Hawaii and the first time leprosis has been observed in the USA since it was eradicated from Florida in the 1960s, although that outbreak was attributed to infection by citrus leprosis virus-N0, a distant relative of OFV (Hartung et al. 2015). The recent detection of citrus leprosis associated with OFV infection in South Africa (Cook et al. 2019) and now Hawaii underscores the threat this pathogen poses to the global citrus industry.},

  abstract = {Parasitised nymphs of Diaphorina communis, a host of ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’, were observed on Bergera koenigii in the Wangdue Phodrang Dzongkhag, Bhutan, and parasitised nymphs of Diaphorina citri were found on Murraya paniculata in the Chukhha Dzongkhag. The nymphs of both hosts were collected along with leaf tissue and placed individually in gelatine capsules. Emerging parasitoids were preserved in ethanol and used either for DNA extraction or morphological examination. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses of the sequence data of the COI, ITS1 and ITS2 regions showed that the parasitoids from the two hosts belonged to two different clades. Morphological examination confirmed that the parasitoids belong to two separate species of Tamarixia, and that the parasitoid from Diaphorina communis is a new species. This is the first record of an ectoparasitoid of Diaphorina communis, and the parasitoid has been named Tamarixia drukyulensis sp. n. The molecular and phylogenetic studies also suggest the occurrence of a eulophid parasitoid or hyperparasitoid of Diaphorina communis belonging to the genus, Aprostocetus.},

  abstract = {The black curry leaf psyllid, Diaphorina communis, is a host of the citrus pathogen, ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (‘CLas’). However, there is a paucity of information on its biology; hence, this study was conducted to evaluate survival and development on citrus, in this instance mandarin (Citrus reticulata) and curry leaf (Bergera koenigii), and transmission of ‘CLas’. Given its similarity with the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), sequences of the COI and 16S genes were examined to see if they could distinguish molecularly between nymphs of these two species. Field and laboratory experiments showed that D. communis nymphs transferred to mandarin branches failed to survive. Adults could survive on flush growth of ‘CLas’-infected mandarin trees; however, little oviposition took place, and the single resulting nymph did not survive to the second instar. These observations suggest that D. communis does not develop, or rarely develops on mandarin and possibly other Citrus spp. Curry leaf appears to be its preferred host, and complete development can take place, possibly exclusively, on this species. Studies on acquisition of ‘CLas’ by D. communis and possible transmission assessed in 2014 and 2015 using greenhouse-grown curry leaf and mandarin seedlings with naturally infected mandarin stumps as a source of ‘CLas’ indicated a low acquisition rate of ‘CLas’. In addition, although D. communis can acquire ‘CLas’, it either cannot transmit it or transmission is limited, and the pathogen may not multiply within the insect. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that differences in COI and 16S regions may prove useful for differentiating between early instar D. communis and D. citri nymphs when fifth instar nymphs and adults are not present on host plants.},

  abstract = {Most flower visitors innately prefer a particular color and scent, and use them as cues for flower recognition and selection. However, in most cases, since color and scent serve as a combined signal, not only does the preference for an individual cue, but also the preference hierarchy among different cues, influence their flower visitation. In the present study, we attempted to reveal (1) the chromatic and (2) the olfactory cues that stimulate flower visiting, and (3) the preference hierarchy between these cues, using the naïve adult butterfly Vanessa indica. When we offered 12 different-colored (six chromatic and six achromatic) paper flower models, V. indica showed a color preference for yellow and blue. When we examined the proboscis extension reflex (PER) of V. indica towards 16 individual compounds identified in the floral scents from two nectar plants belonging to the family Compositae, Taraxacum officinale and Cirsium japonicum, six compounds were found to have relatively high PER-eliciting activities, including benzaldehyde, acetophenone, and (E+Z)-nerolidol. When we combined color and scent cues in two-choice bioassays, where butterflies were offered flower models that were purple (a relatively unattractive color), the models scented with these active compounds were significantly more attractive than the odorless controls. In addition, synthetic blends mimicking the floral scents of T. officinale and C. japonicum (at doses equivalent to that of ten flowers) enhanced the number of visits to the scented models. However, the effect of odorizing was not conspicuous in parallel bioassays when yellow flower models were used, and the butterflies also significantly preferred odorless yellow models to scented purple models. These results demonstrate that V. indica depends primarily on color and secondarily on scent during flower visitation.},

We examined the external and functional morphology of the antennal sensilla of adult male and female T. radiata by using scanning and transmission electron microscopy, respectively, to gain insights into the behavioral ecology of this parasitoid. The geniculate antennae of male and female T. radiata were composed of a long scapula-shaped scape with a basal radicula, a barrel-shaped pedicel, and a long ßagellum with a basal ring-like annulus. Five morphologically distinct sensilla, including two types of aporous trichoid sensilla (AST-1 and AST-2), one multiporous trichoid sensillum (MST), one multiporous placoid sensillum (MPS), and one aporous basiconic capitate peg sensillum were identiÞed on the antennae of both sexes. The antennal structures of T. radiata were sexually dimorphic. Male antennae consisted of four funicular ßagellomeres and possessed a greater number of olfactory MST than female antennae, suggesting their possible function in perception of mate-related volatile cues. Female antennae were characterized by three funicular ßagellomeres and a greater number of MPS than male antennae, suggesting their possible function in the perception of host-related volatile cues. The results are discussed in relation to plausible roles of the identiÞed sensilla in mate and host location by this important parasitoid species.},

Shortly after the onset of stimulation the nymphs turned sharply upwind towards the source of the chemostimuli (within 13±9 s) from mostly downwind and crosswind walks in the air stream alone. The mean vector angles of these upwind tracks were concentrated in a cone 60° either side of due upwind. The upwind walking bugs stopped more frequently but for a shorter duration and walked at a higher speed than before stimulation. During stops in the presence of the chemostimuli the bugs frequently corrected their course angles and extended their forelegs to reach higher with their antennae in the air. In the air stream alone, R. prolixus nymphs frequently sampled the sphere surface with the antennae and cleaned their antennae with the foreleg tarsi. However, the nymphs only briefly tapped the left or right antennal flagellum on the corresponding first leg tarsus and never touched the servosphere surface in the presence of the chemostimuli. After chemostimulus removal from the air stream the bugs continued to respond with the same appetence responses as during stimulation, but walked more tortuously in a crosswind direction in an effort to regain contact with the chemostimuli.},

Adults feed upon foliage where aggregation, mating and oviposition take place. Here, the headspace volatiles from Citrus macrophylla Wester (Rutaceae), D. abbreviatus adults feeding on this plant, adults alone and adult feces, were collected by aeration and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for analysis by gas chromatography-linked mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Electrophysiological responses of weevil antennal receptors to volatile headspace extracts and synthetic analogues were recorded by gas chromatography-linked electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) and electroantennograms (EAGs). Antennal responses were recorded to the monoterpenes (R)-(−)-linalool, citronellal, nerol, citral, and geraniol; all present in the headspace of C. macrophylla. Antennal responses were also recorded to carvacrol, present in the headspace of adults and adult feces. The green leaf volatiles cis-3-hexen-1-ol and trans-2-hexen-1-ol, produced by other host plants, elicited reliable responses on the D. abbreviatus antenna. When comparing EAGs between (±)-linalool and (R)-(−)-linalool, no significant difference was found; responses to (R)-(+)-citronellal were larger than for (S)-(−)-citronellal. Among the individual compounds and blends tested using an open T-track dual choice olfactometer, only the blend of (±)-linalool, cis-3-hexen-1-ol and carvacrol (source dose 25:25:2.5~μg) elicited significant attraction of females, the same blend was repellent for males.

  abstract = {The Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a diurnal insect that strongly relies on visual cues to guide its walk. In the present study, we investigated the orientation behavior of non-diapausing walking CPB in response to emissive colors produced by light emitting diodes (LEDs) in a dual choice arena adapted to a servosphere, where the only illumination available came from the photo-stimuli. Our results demonstrate that CPB show positive phototactic behavior when stimulated with different wavelengths of light; they preferred to orient towards white (420–775 nm), ultraviolet (UV) (351 nm), blue (472 nm), green (570 nm), yellow (585 nm), orange (590 nm), and red (660 nm) over darkness when both alternatives were offered, but no orientation responses were elicited by infrared (940 nm). Both males and females preferred yellow and green over other colors, but did not show any particular preference between them, thus correlating with their preference for wavelengths reflected by vegetation. Sexual differences were noted in that male CPB preferred white over either red or UV, whereas female CPB did not show any preferences when offered these colors. Female CPB preferred UV and blue over red, whereas males showed no preferences when these colors were offered. Colorado potato beetles turned at higher angles and performed more tortuous walks in complete darkness and when infrared vs. darkness were offered compared with the rest of the colored lights. Both sexes preferred continuous over pulsed yellow light. Colorado potato beetles subjected to pulsed yellow light showed a temporal alteration of their walking performance by walking less, slower, and turning at a higher rate.

  abstract = {Orientation of insects to host plants and conspecifics is the result of detection and integration of chemical and physical cues present in the environment. Sensory organs have evolved to be sensitive to important signals, providing neural input for higher order multimodal processing and behavioral output. Here we report experiments to determine decisions made by Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata, in response to isolated stimuli and multimodal combinations of signals on a locomotion compensator. Our results show that in complete darkness and in the absence of other stimuli, pheromonal stimulation increases attraction behavior of CPB as measured in oriented displacement and walking speed. However, orientation to the pheromone is abolished when presented with the alternative stimulation of a low intensity yellow light in a dark environment. The ability of the pheromone to stimulate these diurnal beetles in the dark in the absence of other stimuli is an unexpected but interesting observation. The predominance of the phototactic response over that to pheromone when low intensity lights were offered as choices seems to confirm the diurnal nature of the insect. The biological significance of the response to pheromone in the dark is unclear. The phototactic response will play a key role in elucidating multimodal stimulation in the host-finding process of CPB, and perhaps other insects. Such information might be exploited in the design of applications to attract and trap CPB for survey or control purposes and other insect pests using similar orientation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The tropical root weevil Diaprepes abbreviatus is a major pest of multiple crops in the Caribbean Islands and has become a serious constraint to citrus production in the United States. Recent work has identified host and conspecific volatiles that mediate host- and mate-finding by D. abbreviatus. The interaction of light, color, and odors has not been studied in this species. The responses of male and female D. abbreviatus to narrow bandwidths of visible light emitted by LEDs offered alone and in combination with olfactory stimuli were studied in a specially-designed multiple choice arena combined with a locomotion compensator. Weevils were more attracted to wavelengths close to green and yellow compared with blue or ultraviolet, but preferred red and darkness over green. Additionally, dim green light was preferred over brighter green. Adult weevils were also attracted to the odor of its citrus host + conspecifics. However, the attractiveness of citrus + conspecific odors disappeared in the presence of a green light. Photic stimulation induced males but not females to increase their speed. In the presence of light emitted by LEDs, turning speed decreased and path straightness increased, indicating that weevils tended to walk less tortuously. Diaprepes abbreviatus showed a hierarchy between chemo- and photo-taxis in the series of experiments presented herein, where the presence of the green light abolished upwind anemotaxis elicited by the pheromone + host plant odor. Insight into the strong responses to visual stimuli of chemically stimulated insects may be provided when the amount of information supplied by vision and olfaction is compared, as the information transmission capacity of compound eyes is estimated to be several orders of magnitude higher compared with the olfactory system. Subordination of olfactory responses by photic stimuli should be considered in the design of strategies aimed at management of such insects.},

We discuss the historical and philosophical roots of this behavioral-scientific problem. We admit anthropomorphic inference of organisms’ behaviors, as a mean to create scientific-novel knowledge. We present two examples –based on the ethological study of triatomines (vectors of Chagas disease)–, where our anthropomorphic approach resulted in the discovery of novel meanings.},

  abstract = {Biological control is an important ecosystem service delivered by natural enemies. Together with breeding for plant defence, it constitutes one of the most promising alternatives to pesticides for controlling herbivores in sustainable crop production. Especially induced plant defences may be promising targets in plant breeding for resistance against arthropod pests. Because they are activated upon herbivore damage, costs are only incurred when defence is needed. Moreover, they can be more specific than constitutive defences. Nevertheless, inducible defence traits that are harming plant pest organisms may interfere with biological control agents, such as predators and parasitoids. Despite the vast fundamental knowledge on plant defence mechanisms and their effects on natural enemies, our understanding of the feasibility of combining biological control with induced plant defence in practice is relatively poor. In this review, we focus on arthropod pest control and present the most important features of biological control with natural enemies and of induced plant defence. Furthermore, we show potential synergies and conflicts among them and, finally, identify gaps and list opportunities for their combined use in crop protection. We suggest that breeders should focus on inducible resistance traits that are compatible with the natural enemies of arthropod pests, specifically traits that help communities of natural enemies to build up.},

While some optimal plant species for ACP oviposition and development have been identified, little is known of the influence of host plants on ACP size and shape. Our goal was to determine how size and shape of ACP wing and body size varies when development occurs on different host plants in a controlled rearing environment. ACP were reared on six different rutaceous species; Bergera koenigii, Citrus aurantifolia, Citrus macrophylla, Citrus maxima, Citrus taiwanica and Murraya paniculata. Adults were examined for morphometric variation using traditional and geometric analysis based on 12 traits or landmarks. ACP reared on C. taiwanica were consistently smaller than those reared on the other plant species. Wing aspect ratio also differed between C. maxima and C. taiwanica. Significant differences in shape were detected with those reared on M. paniculata having narrower wings than those reared on C. macrophylla. This study provides evidence of wing size and shape differences of ACP based on host plant species which potentially may impact dispersal. Further study is needed to determine if behavioral and physiological differences are associated with the observed phenotypic differences.},

We evaluated the effects of light of specific wavelength and polarization on phototactic behavior of D. citri using a horizontal bioassay arena. Wavelength-associated positive phototaxis was associated with short wavelength UV (350–405 nm) targets whereas little or no responses were seen in longer wavelength targets in the visible spectrum from green to orange (500–620 nm). Distance walked towards the visual target was greater for UV/blue wavelengths (350–430 nm) than for longer wavelengths. Distances walked towards 365 nm light were greater than to white light, and distances travelled to green, yellow and orange light were similar to those in darkness. A reduced light intensity decreased responses to white and UV (365 nm) light. Polarized light was discriminated and D. citri travelled greater distance in response to white vertically polarized light than to horizontally polarized or unpolarized light of equal intensity. Responses to polarized 405 nm light were greater than to unpolarized light, although without an effect of polarization plane. For 500 nm light, there was no difference between responses to polarized or unpolarized light. There was no effect of age on responses to 405 nm light although 1 day old psyllids travelled faster in the presence of 500 nm green compared to 4–7 day old psyllids. Movement in response to UV and relative stasis in response to longer wavelength light is consistent with observed behaviors of settling on foliage for feeding and dispersing out of the canopy when flush needed for reproduction is scarce.},

  abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) is the most serious disease affecting citriculture worldwide. Its vector in the main producing regions is the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, 1908 (Hemiptera: Liviidae). Brazil has the largest orange-growing area and is also the largest exporter of processed juice in the world. Since the first detection of the disease in this country, {$>$}38 million plants have been destroyed and pesticide consumption has increased considerably. During early research on control methods, the parasitoid Tamarixia radiata (Waterston, 1922) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) was found in Brazil. Subsequent studies focused on its bio-ecological aspects and distribution in citrus-producing regions. Based on successful preliminary results for biological control with T. radiata in small areas, mass rearing was initiated for mass releases in Brazilian conditions. Here, we review the Brazilian experience using T. radiata in D. citri control, with releases at sites of HLB outbreaks, adjacent to commercial areas, in abandoned groves, areas with orange jessamine (a psyllid host), and backyards.},

These advances make our country a model for this type of pest control, especially since 1980, with the development of improved rearing techniques. In association with private companies, the use of BC has grown more than in the rest of the world, advancing by about 10–15\% each year. Abstract This article describes the importance of rearing insects, whether on a small scale for research or a large scale for mass rearing, for use in biological control (BC) programs with macro-organisms. These inter- or multidisciplinary research programs are necessarily long-term and depend on rearing techniques for their complete development. Some successful examples of BC in Brazil are presented, including case studies of Trichogramma spp. These required broad bioecological studies that provided the basis for both mass rearing and transfer of the necessary technology to farmers. This has allowed Brazil to occupy a leadership position in biological control in “Open Fields”. For example, about three million ha are being treated with Trichogramma galloi (a native parasitoid), and about three and a half million ha with Cotesia flavipes (an exotic parasitoid) to control Diatraea saccharalis, the sugarcane borer. These natural enemies are produced by commercial firms, or by laboratories in sugar and alcohol plants themselves, in the case of C. flavipes.

Colored, gray, and white cards were used as visual targets. Each card was attached to a glass thistle tube from which host-plant odor (from Vigna unguiculata L.) or blank, humidified air was dispensed. Visual + odor stimuli combinations were presented in no-choice tests. Nymphs were released onto a perch stick downwind from the target. Nymph response to color + odor treatments was measured by the duration of orientation behavior, residence time on the perch, and percentage of individuals that jumped to the target. The assay was modified so that adults crawled from the perch onto the target. Adult response was measured by the duration of individual behaviors (e.g., foraging) and by their position and residence time on the target. Both main effects and interactive effects of the stimuli were observed. Nymphs showed a decrease in orientation and residence times in the colored target + host odor treatments and increased jumping response in the gray + host odor treatment. When adults were exposed to host odor, the duration of foraging behavior increased, whereas crawling and phototactic behaviors decreased. Although nymphs and adults responded to visual stimuli + blank air treatments, host odor enhanced their responses. The primary effect of host odor on host detection behavior may be to enhance H. coagulata responsiveness to visual cues.},

D. citri reproduces and develops only on the flushing shoots of its rutaceous host plants. Here we examined whether D. citri is attracted to host plant odors and a mixture of synthetic terpenes. Tests conducted in a vertically oriented Y-tube olfactometer showed that both males and females preferentially entered the Y-tube arm containing the odor from the young shoots of Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack and Citrus limon L. Burm. f. cultivar Eureka. Only males exhibited a preference for the odor of C. sinensis L., whereas the odor of C. × paradisi MacFadyen cultivar Rio Red was not attractive to both sexes. The volatiles emitted by young shoots of grapefruit cultivar Rio Red, Meyer lemon (Citrus × limon L. Burm.f.), and M. paniculata were analyzed by gas chromatograph–mass spectrometry. The samples were comprised of monoterpenes, monoterpene esters, and sesquiterpenes. The number of compounds present varied from 2 to 17, whereas the total amount of sample collected over 6 h ranged from 5.6 to 119.8 ng. The quantitatively dominant constituents were (E)-\&bgr;-ocimene, linalool, linalyl acetate, and \&bgr;-caryophyllene. The attractiveness of a mixture of synthetic terpenes, modeled on the volatiles collected from M. paniculata, was evaluated in screened cages in a no-choice test. At three observation intervals, significantly more individuals were trapped on white targets scented with the mixture than on unscented targets. These results indicate the feasibility of developing D. citri attractants patterned on actual host plant volatiles.},

  abstract = {We are developing an autodisseminator (‘dispenser’) to inoculate Asian citrus psyllid with entomopathogens for the purpose of inducing epizootics in residential trees and abandoned groves, areas where chemical control is problematic. The dispenser prototype consisted of a bright yellow pleated tube coated with a spore formulation made from pulverized cotton burrs and blastospores of Isaria fumosorosea. Adult psyllids were released within an array of dispensers and potted citrus saplings in a greenhouse. After 24 h, they were collected from the foliage, surface sterilized, and placed in an incubator. A mean of 55\% of the adults developed mycosis (n = 3 tests), demonstrating that the dispensers could cause primary infection. The potted plants used in the horizontal transmission tests were infested with immature psyllids; 27–35\% of which became infected following contact with adults that had visited the dispensers (n = 2 tests). When mycosed adult cadavers with mature conidia were placed near immatures on the potted plants, over 90\% of the immatures mycosed, indicating that conidia from the cadavers were highly contagious. On dispensers left in the greenhouse for three weeks, the infectivity of blastospores exposed to direct sunlight decreased by 46\% after 7 d and by 60\% after 20 d, while infectivity levels remained high in blastospores that were shaded. These results confirmed that that the basic dispenser design was sound with respect to attracting and infecting psyllids. It requires further modification to work effectively under ambient conditions, since exposure to direct sunlight decreased blastospore infectiveness over time.},

In laboratory studies, nymphs reared on Las infected plants were more likely to acquire the bacterium than adults. Acquisition by nymphs ranged from 60 to 100\%, whereas acquisition by adults only reached 40\% after 5 wk of feeding on Las-infected plants. Similar rates of pathogen acquisition by psyllids after nymphal and adult feeding were observed in the Þeld. Transmission of Las from parent to offspring (transovarial) occurred at a rate of 2Ð 6\%. One year after psyllid inoculations, successful transmission by individual D. citri ranged from 4 to 10\%, whereas groups of 100 or more D. citri transmitted the pathogen at a rate of Ϸ88\%. In addition, the proportion of Las-positive adult psyllids, determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, decreased over time when held on healthy plants. Due to the low rate of pathogen acquisition and long time period required for successful inoculation by adult D. citri, experiments designed to determine the latent period required for replication and successful inoculation of Las by D. citri did not result in Las-infected plants after Ͼ1 yr of incubation after inoculation. Collectively, these results indicate that adult D. citri which acquire the HLB pathogen as adults are poor vectors of the pathogen compared with adults that acquired the pathogen as nymphs.},

  abstract = {The West Indian sugarcane rootstalk borer weevil, Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.) has been an important pest of several crops (i.e., citrus, sugarcane, vegetables, ornamentals) in Florida for over 30 years. In Florida, annual losses and cost of control in citrus currently exceeds 72 million dollars, while losses in ornamentals and vegetables were close to 2 million dollars during 1997 through 1999. Different pest management tactics are being developed to manage Diaprepes abbreviatus and they include autacoidal and chemical methods, plant resistance and use of biopesticides. Biological control by entomophagous insects is viewed as well suited for management of Diaprepes abbreviatus, because of its minimal physical input, cost-effectiveness and because it offers the potential for long-lasting control of the target pest. However, until today, very little effort has been made to include the use of entomophagous insects in the whole management program for Diaprepes abbreviatus. Entomophagous insects are divided into two general classes the parasitoids and the predators. The term parasitoid, when applied to an entomophagous insect, refers to one that, in its larval stage, develops either internally or externally upon a single host individual, and the host eventually dies as a result of the attack. Parasitoids as adults are, with few exceptions, free-living, and their food sources are usually distinct from those of the larvae (DeBach, 1974). Biological control of Diaprepes species by parasitoids and predators already present in Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe and Florida has been observed (Table 1) (Whitcomb et al., 1982; Beavers et al., 1980; Peña et al., unpublished data; Etienne et al., 1990). On the other hand, some conflicting reports exist in the literature about adult and larval parasitoids of this pest (Thompson, 1943). For instance, there are reports of the existence of a larval parasitoid of Diaprepes in Brazil, while there is no evidence that Diaprepes is distributed in that area. Thus, there has been short-lived research on parasitoids as control agents of Diaprepes abbreviatus. It is quite important to re-direct efforts to the development of a management system which take all possible advantage of naturally occurring biological control and that considers the possibility of intensive studies of natural enemies in the area of origin of Diaprepes abbreviatus.},

  abstract = {Brevipalpus mites (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) carrying citrus leprosis virus are considered serious quarantine pests. The objective of this research was to clarify the effectiveness of commonly used fruit cleaners, soaps, waxes, and mechanical brushing techniques (alone and in combination) on removal and/or mortality of mites (percentage of density reduction) from infested citrus fruits. Six bioassays were conducted with infested lemons, Citrus limon (L.) Burm.f. (Sapindales: Rutaceae), using non-virulent Brevipalpus yothersi Baker as a model species. In each bioassay, all stages (eggs, nymphs, and adults) of B. yothersi were recorded before and after treatment. Results indicated that none of the treatments provided 100\% reduction of all stages of mites, as would be required for quarantine treatments. In general, mite reduction following single treatments (soap rinse, brushing, or waxing alone) was not significantly different from reduction obtained with a water drench control. However, several combination treatments were successful in achieving ∼90\% reduction of mites, particularly those that included application of a food-grade wax coating. Therefore, a combination of treatments, including a soap wash and mechanical brushing followed by a wax coating, may be the most effective method to achieve significant reduction of all stages of Brevipalpus mites from infested citrus. Especímenes de Brevipalpus yothersi (Acari: Tenuipalpidae) que sean vectores de la leprosis de los cítricos se consideran plagas cuarentenarias. El objetivo de esta investigación fue el de clarificar la efectividad de substancias utilizadas para limpiar la fruta como jabones, ceras y técnicas como el cepillado mecánico de los frutos (utilizadas singularmente o en combinación) sobre la remoción o mortalidad causada en los ácaros infestando frutos de cítricos. Se hicieron seis bioensayos probando los tratamientos mencionados antes en limón Citrus limon (L.) Burm. f. (Sapindales: Rutaceae), usando, Brevipalpus yothersi Baker no-virulento como especie modelo. En cada bioensayo todos los estados (huevos, estados inmaduros y adultos) de B. yothersi infestando limones, fueron evaluados antes y después de tratamiento. Los resultados indicaron que ninguno de los tratamientos causaba el 100\% de reducción de todos los estados de los ácaros, lo cual es requerido en tratamientos de cuarentena. En general, la reducción de ácaros después de un solo tratamiento (jabones, limpiadores, cepillado o encerado solo) no fue significativamente diferente del testigo representado por la inmersión de los limones en agua. Sin embargo, la combinación de varios tratamientos resultó en ∼90\% de reducción de ácaros, particularmente cuando estos incluían la aplicación de ceras utilizadas para recubrir la fruta. En consecuencia, la combinación de tratamientos incluyendo una solución jabonosa, cepillado mecánico, seguido por en encerado de la fruta, podría ser el tratamiento más efectivo para alcanzar la reducción significativa de todos los estados de ácaros Brevipalpus cuando estos están infestando cítricos.},

Although OFV shares clear sequence similarities with rhabdoviruses, its taxonomic status is undetermined because its negative-sense RNA genome is bipartite. This review presents a general overview of classical and contemporary findings about etiology, serology, epidemiology, pathology, molecular biology, detection and prevention methods of orchid fleck virus. Because of the characteristics of OFV and viruses of the Rhabdoviridae and Mononegavirales, it is proposed that a new genus of negative-sense RNA plant viruses outside of the Mononegavirales be established with orchid fleck virus as the type species.},

It is caused by the fastidious gram-negative α-proteobacteria bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) and vectored by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri. Currently, there is no cure for HLB, no compounds have been successful in controlling HLB, and no sustainable management practices have been established for the disease. Thus, searching for alternative citrus greening disease mitigation strategies is considered an urgent priority for a sustainable citrus industry. The aim of this study was to use compounds extracted from oak, Quercus hemisphaerica, and to assess the antibacterial effects of these against CLas-infected citrus plants. The application of aqueous oak leaf extracts showed substantial inhibitory effects against CLas in citrus plants and the activity of genes related to starch. Significant differences were also observed in plant phenotypic and physiological traits after treatments. Citrus plants treated with oak extracts displayed an increase in stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content and nutrient uptake concurrently with a reduction of CLas titer, when compared to citrus plants treated with just water. The information provided from this study suggests a new management treatment program to effectively deal with the HLB disease.},

Monthly surveys were conducted at 4 locations during 2004 through 2005 to evaluate citrus flushing patterns, psyllid densities, and prevalence of parasitism by Tamarixia radiata. Although low levels of D. citri are known to be established in the high, cool areas of Adjuntas, a total lack of psyllids at the particular study location was attributed to scarcity of flush except for a short period in Feb. Greatest and most prolonged production of new flush, highest psyllid numbers, and greatest incidence of parasitism occurred at Isabela, the most coastal location and the only one with irrigated citrus.

  abstract = {Management of ‘huanglongbing’ (HLB) or the Asian form of citrus greening disease caused by the bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, and spread by Diaphorina citri Kuwayama depends largely on the management of the vector insect. Seventeen experiments conducted during 2006–2007 included D. citri colonies initiated with eggs or first instar nymphs on young shoots protected with sleeve cages, sticky barriers or left unprotected through adult emergence to assess the relative impact of abiotic and biotic factors on psyllid populations. Temperatures dropped to 0 °C and killed most of the shoots and nymphs in February 2007. Spiders (Araneae) and insects in the families Coccinellidae, Blattellidae, Chrysopidae, Formicidae, Syrphidae, Anthocoridae and Miridae were observed on colonies or caught in sticky barriers. The ladybeetles Olla v-nigrum, Curinus coeruleus, Harmonia axyridis, and Cycloneda sanguinea, the cockroach Blattella asahinai, lacewings, Ceraeochrysa sp. and Chrysoperla sp., and spiders were most often encountered. Parasitism by Tamarixia radiata provided 1–3\% nymphal mortality in relation to adult emergence although a maximum of about 25\% was observed. Net reproductive rate (R0), based on observed survivorship and temperature-dependent fecundity data was estimated to be 5- to 27-fold higher in the colonies protected with full cages compared to the unprotected colonies except during the freeze. At the extreme, R0 was estimated in caged colonies at 125–285 in Jun 2006 whereas all nymphs disappeared in the unprotected colonies. Intermediate results were observed in colonies protected with sticky barriers or coarse mesh cages. These findings suggest that biotic factors play a vital role in regulating populations of D. citri. Their elimination through reckless pesticide use could increase pest pressure and enhance the spread of the disease. Therefore, integrated control programs based on conservation of natural enemies of D. citri through judicious use of insecticides and releases of new parasitoids are needed for sustainable management of pest and disease.},

  abstract = {Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), vectors the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, one of the causal organisms of the devastating citrus disease “huanglongbing” or citrus greening. In the United States, D. citri was Þrst discovered in Florida, in 1998. Tamarixia radiata Waterston (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) was imported from Asia and released in Florida in 1999 Ð2001 to improve biological control of D. citri before citrus greening was detected in Florida in 2005. Florida citrus groves were surveyed during 2006 Ð2007 for D. citri and T. radiata. Results showed that D. citri was established in all 28 citrus groves surveyed across 16 counties. Adult populations averaged 3.52, 1.27, and 1.66 individuals per “tap” sample at locations in the central, southwest, and eastern coastal regions, respectively. A tap sample consisted of 22- by 28-cm white paper sheet (on a clipboard) held under branches selected at random that were tapped three times. Averages of 67, 44, and 45\% citrus shoots infested with psyllid eggs or nymphs were obtained in the central, southwest, and eastern coastal regions, respectively. T. radiata was recovered from fourth- and Þfth-instar psyllid nymphs at 26 of the 28 locations. However, apparent parasitism rates were variable and averaged Ͻ20\% during spring and summer over all locations. Incidence of parasitism increased during fall at some locations, averaging 39\% in September and 56\% in November in the central and southwest regions, respectively. Further efforts are warranted to enhance the biological control of D. citri and thereby reduce psyllid populations and spread of citrus greening disease.},

  abstract = {Communication between flowering plants and their pollinators involves innate, learned and deceptive sensory signals. Nocturnal, hawkmoth-pollinated flowers are among the most reflective and strongly scented known, suggesting the potential for multimodal sensory communication with pollinators. We measured the relative importance of these overstated signals, both alone and in combination, to nectar feeding by naı̈ve male hawkmoths, Manduca sexta. In the absence of fragrance, moths hovered and repeatedly passed (in flight) within 1m above arrays of model paper flowers. The presence of plant odours elicited significantly more hovers and close passes, as well as three additional behaviours: approaches to the paper flowers, approaches to the hidden odour source and nectar feeding. However, approaches to odour sources never resulted in proboscis extension or probing in the absence of a visual target. Nectar feeding increased six-fold when paper and natural flowers were presented in mixed arrays, but moths did not show preferential visits or constancy to either type of flower. Significantly ordered behavioural sequences were observed when both visual and olfactory stimuli were present, but not when fragrance was absent. The largest conditional probabilities indicated a chain of responses beginning with hovering and leading to floral approach and nectar feeding. As single modality cues, both floral fragrance and visual display are innately attractive to male M. sexta, but the combination thereof is required to elicit proboscis extension and feeding.},

  abstract = {We performed field experiments to measure the relative importance of olfactory and visual cues in nectar foraging by wild tobacco hornworm moths, Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae) in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, U.S.A. We manipulated flowers of sacred Datura (Datura wrightii; Solanaceae) to experimentally decouple floral scent from visual display and presented these cues to free-flying moths in mixed and homogeneous arrays. Moths did not feed from cloth-bagged fragrant flowers lacking strong visual contrast, nor did they feed from paper model flowers lacking plant odours. Unexpectedly, moths fed from paper model flowers that were associated solely with vegetative odours, albeit at lower levels than when floral scent was present. Subsequent experiments revealed that the combination of floral and vegetative odours did not incrementally increase nectar feeding and that floral scent without vegetation was sufficient to elicit feeding when paper flowers were present. Thus, wild M. sexta in our study did not show generalized feeding responses to natural or artificial flowers with single sensory stimuli; like naïve laboratory-reared moths, they required a combination of visual and olfactory cues. However, given the prior foraging experience of our study population on Datura flowers, their lack of generalized feeding responses may reflect a learned preference for the full complement of floral cues, rather than the persistence of innate sensory constraints. Future efforts to distinguish between these hypotheses should focus on whether M. sexta can be conditioned to associate nectar with visual cues alone, and whether moths that feed ad libitum from nectar-rich plants learn floral attributes as a search image or generalize to single-modality stimuli.},

  abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) is a difficult-to-control and highly destructive citrus disease that, in Brazil, is associated mainly with the bacterium ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ transmitted by the psyllid Diaphorina citri. The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of the ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ infection process by exposing excised, fully expanded, immature citrus leaves in 50-ml Falcon tubes to one, four, or eight adults from a ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’-exposed colony for 1-, 3-, 7-, or 15-day periods for access to inoculation (IAP). The leaves were incubated at 26°C for 1, 3, 7, 15, and 21 days (incubation period [IP]). Infection frequencies and ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ titers were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ infection was a function of leaf age, number of insects, IAP, and IP. In general, higher infection rates were observed on younger leaves inoculated with higher numbers of insects and after longer IAP and IP. The immature excised leaf method allowed determination of 3 to 7 days as the range of time required by ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ to reach qPCR detectable levels. Even though leaf survival could be prolonged by the maintenance of a branch segment at the base of the leaf petiole, leaf degradation, visible after about 15 days IP, did not allow observation of the entire infection process which, in the intact plant, culminates with the appearance of the blotch mottling symptom on leaf blades.},

Beentje \& J. Dransf., Arecaceae. It is likely that the presence of the pest is restricted yet, because this plant was imported from Brazil for garden ornamentation. Visual observations were made in other nurseries of the same locality; however, the red mite has not been detected. Therefore, it is necessary to permanently monitor the host plants, also in banana plantations in order to verify the occurrence of the red mite, and implement integrated management and prevent its spread. The mite is a threat to the production of bananas; a sector of great economic importance which benefits the small producer, it is the most consumed fruit in the country and besides it is exported.},

  abstract = {Citrus leprosis (CL) is a viral disease endemic to the Western Hemisphere that produces local necrotic and chlorotic lesions on leaves, branches, and fruit and causes serious yield reduction in citrus orchards. Samples of sweet orange (Citrus × sinensis) trees showing CL symptoms were collected during a survey in noncommercial citrus areas in the southeast region of Brazil in 2013 to 2016. Transmission electron microscopy analyses of foliar lesions confirmed the presence of rod-like viral particles commonly associated with CL in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells. However, every attempt to identify these particles by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests failed, even though all described primers for the detection of known CL-causing cileviruses and dichorhaviruses were used. Next-generation sequencing of total RNA extracts from three symptomatic samples revealed the genome of distinct, although highly related (¿92\% nucleotide sequence identity), viruses whose genetic organization is similar to that of dichorhaviruses. The genome sequence of these viruses showed 62\% nucleotide sequence identity with those of orchid fleck virus and coffee ringspot virus. Globally, the deduced amino acid sequences of the open reading frames they encode share 32.7 to 63.8\% identity with the proteins of the dichorhavirids. Mites collected from both the naturally infected citrus trees and those used for the transmission of one of the characterized isolates to Arabidopsis plants were anatomically recognized as Brevipalpus phoenicis sensu stricto. Molecular and biological features indicate that the identified viruses belong to a new species of CL-associated dichorhavirus, which we propose to call Citrus leprosis N dichorhavirus. Our results, while emphasizing the increasing diversity of viruses causing CL disease, lead to a reevaluation of the nomenclature of those viruses assigned to the genus Dichorhavirus. In this regard, a comprehensive discussion is presented.},

In 2019, an A. rosea plant showing symptoms of irregular chlorotic flecking on the basal leaves, with symptoms becoming gradually less severe toward the apex, was sampled in Pretoria, Gauteng province, South Africa. Total RNA was used to prepare an RNAtag-seq library, which was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. Subsequent analysis of the data revealed the presence of two bipartite RNA viruses, namely orchid fleck virus (OFV) (segment 1: MW073772; segment 2: MW073773) and sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV) (segment 1: MW073774; segment 2: MW073775). OFV from this study was closely related to a strain from South Africa, associated with citrus leprosis disease, while SPCSV represented a novel strain. RT-PCR and bidirectional Sanger sequencing were used to confirm the presence of both viruses. Further samples were collected in 2020, which showed severe interveinal chlorosis, and were tested with RT-PCR; however only SPCSV was associated with these plants. This is the first time that both viruses have been associated with A. rosea, which should be considered a potential reservoir host of these agriculturally important viruses.},

  abstract = {Plant semiochemicals are known to produce a wide range of behavioral responses in insects. Some insects sequester or acquire host plant compounds and use them as sex pheromones or sex pheromone precursors. Other insects produce or release sex pheromones in response to specific host plant cues, and chemicals from host plants often synergistically enhance the response of an insect to sex pheromones. Plant volatiles can also have inhibitory or repellent effects that interrupt insect responses to pheromones and attract predators and parasitoids to the attacking species after herbivory injury. Here, we review different interactions between plant semiochemicals and insect pheromones, paying attention to those that can result in the development of more efficient and reliable programs for pest control.},

  abstract = {The sweetpotato weevil, Cylas formicarius (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Brentidae), is the most serious pest of sweetpotato around the world, damaging sweetpotatoes in the field and in storage, as well as being a quarantine pest. Because the larval period is spent within vines or tubers, and the adults are nocturnal, chemical control frequently is not effective. In addition, there are few natural enemies, and pheromone-based trapping does not appear to reduce the damage level. In the present study, we evaluated a number of parameters that affect pheromone-based trap catch, including trap design, trap size, trap color, and height at which the traps are placed. Pherocon unitraps caught higher numbers than ground, funnel water, or delta traps. Medium-sized traps (13\,×\,17.5~cm) were more effective than larger or smaller traps. In a color-choice test, C. formicarius preferred red over gray, brown, blue, white, yellow, black, or red traps; light red was more attractive than other shades of red. Maximum catches were obtained when the traps were set 50~cm above the crop canopy. Light-red unitraps with pheromone lures caught more adults than identical traps without lures, suggesting that C. formicarius is influenced by both visual and olfactory cues. Pheromone-baited light-red unitraps, 13\,×\,17.5~cm, installed 50~cm above the crop canopy, were the most effective at catching C. formicarius adults, and they appear to have the greatest potential for use in trap-and-kill strategies and eradication programs.},

  abstract = {Flying insects exhibit stunning behavioral repertoires that are largely mediated by the visual control of flight. For this reason, presenting a controlled visual environment to tethered insects has been and continues to be a powerful tool for studying the sensory control of complex behaviors. To create an easily controlled, scalable, and customizable visual stimulus, we have designed a modular system, based on panels composed of an 8×8 array of individual LEDs, that may be connected together to ‘tile’ an experimental environment with controllable displays. The panels have been designed to be extremely bright, with the added flexibility of individual-pixel brightness control, allowing experimentation over a broad range of behaviorally relevant conditions. Patterns to be displayed may be designed using custom software, downloaded to a controller board, and displayed on the individually addressed panels via a rapid communication interface. The panels are controlled by a microprocessor-based display controller which, for most experiments, will not require a computer in the loop, greatly reducing the experimental infrastructure. This technology allows an experimenter to build and program a visual arena with a customized geometry in a matter of hours. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we present results from experiments with tethered Drosophila melanogaster: (1) in a cylindrical arena composed of 44 panels, used to test the contrast dependence of object orientation behavior, and (2) above a 30-panel floor display, used to examine the effects of ground motion on orientation during flight.},

By 2008, it spread to at least twelve islands, to two counties in Florida and to Venezuela. Red palm mite causes yellowing and leaf necrosis with severe reduction of leaf stomatal conductance. Growers are reporting {$>$} 70\% reduction in coconut yield. Genetic studies of red palm mite collected from multiple regions in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean revealed several distinct haplotypes. All Caribbean samples have the same haplotype, which matches samples from coconut in Réunion and areca palms in India. The populations from coconut in India exhibited a different haplotype. Biological control and pesticide options are being studied to manage the pest. The efficacy of acaricides against red palm mite was tested to provide palm, banana and ornamental nursery growers with an updated list of acaricides with good control potential. Natural enemy studies in the Caribbean have shown that thrips, phytoseiid, lacewing, and coccinelid predators attack red palm mites. Fungal infections have been reported in Puerto Rico, Dominica and Trinidad. Predatory mite numbers, especially in the Phytoseiidae, increase in response to higher numbers of red palm mites. However, these local predators are apparently not controlling red palm mite outbreaks. Foreign exploration for natural enemies is being conducted in Mauritius and India. A phytoseiid predator is currently being evaluated in quarantine in Gainesville, Florida.},

  abstract = {Variation in sperm precedence was examined in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say, using neutral allozyme markers. Two temporal components were studied: (1) pairing duration and (2) time since initial pairing. We used two pairing protocols that differed in the time males and females were allowed to mate for first and second pairings. When pairings were limited to 8 h each for the first and second male, the proportion of offspring in the xth egg mass attributable to the second male, P2(x), rose from 68\% in the first egg mass after pairing with the second male to 78\% in the tenth egg mass. When pairing was extended so that the first male-female pair had time to produce three egg masses and the second male was allowed to remain with the female indefinitely, P2(x) rose from 44\% in the first egg mass after pairing with the second male to nearly 100\% in the third and subsequent egg masses. Observations that (1) multiple matings are necessary to fill the female’s spermatheca and (2) the last male accounts for a greater proportion of offspring with time, provide evidence for both the sperm mixing and sperm displacement hypotheses. These data also help to explain male-guarding behavior in Colorado potato beetle. Because the allozyme markers were shown to be neutral with respect to fitness, other aspects of mating behavior could be tested by establishing a similar series of unique lines.},

Detection of invasive pests usually relies upon changes in vegetation properties as result of the pest activity. These changes may be visible in time series of satellite data records, such as Landsat satellites, which have been available with a 16-day repeat cycle at a spatial resolution of 30 m since 1982. Typical red palm mite infestations result in the yellowing of the lower leaves of the palm crown; remote sensing model simulations have indicated that this feature may be better detected using the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI). Using the Google Earth Engine programming environment, a time series of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data was generated for plantations in northern and northeast Brazil, El Salvador, and Trinidad-Tobago. Considering the available studied plantations, there were little or no differences of GNDVI before and after the dates when red palm mites were first revealed at each location. A discussion of possible alternative approaches are discussed related to the limitations of the current satellite platforms.},

  abstract = {A series of field experiments was conducted in cranberry bogs in 2006–2010 to determine adult attraction of the two most economically important leafhopper pests of cultivated Vaccinium spp. in the northeast USA, the blunt-nosed leafhopper, Limotettix vaccinii (Van Duzee), and the sharp-nosed leafhopper, Scaphytopius magdalensis (Provancher), to colored (yellow, green, red, blue, white, and clear) sticky traps. We also determined the effects of trap height on insect captures, evaluated trap color characteristics (i.e., reflectance spectra, and red, green, and blue RGB values) for maximizing leafhopper capture while minimizing beneficial arthropod capture, and correlated within-season adult leafhopper captures from traps with nymphal captures from sweep nets. Leafhopper species exhibited distinct preferences to particular colors differing in intensities along a spectrum of wavelengths and RGB values: green was the most attractive color to blunt-nosed leafhoppers, followed by red and yellow; while yellow was most attractive to sharp-nosed leafhoppers, followed by green and red. Attraction of leafhoppers to other colors was similar to clear. Most insect predators (e.g. lady beetles, hoverflies, and minute pirate bugs), parasitic wasps, and honey bees also exhibited preferences to particular trap color characteristics, whereas green lacewings and spiders did not. An effective attraction radius was calculated for each color of trap and species. Additionally, we measured mean~±~SD of flight heights of several species and showed that more leafhoppers and hoverflies were captured on red and yellow traps placed 0.1~m above the canopy; while captures of lady beetles were highest on traps placed 0.5~m above the canopy. Numbers of adult leafhoppers on traps were largely uncorrelated with numbers of nymphs in sweep net samples, except for blunt-nosed leafhoppers captured on red traps which were positively correlated with sweep net counts. We discuss the potential of using colored sticky traps to monitor leafhopper populations in the context of their non-target species effects in cranberries.},

Specifically, the rose-colored exudate produced on sporulating cultures of Mexican HtM120I strain sterilized female spider mites in a dose-dependent fashion. Topical application of the exudate resulted in a 100\% reduction in mite fecundity over the initial six days of experimentation. Depending upon the exudate dosage, mites partially recovered within 3 and 6 d post-treatment and produced a limited number of eggs. The spider mite active HtM120I exudate contained less detectable HtA toxin than the HtM120I broth filtrate, and it was innocuous when injected into the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella L. larvae. Broth filtrates of HtM120I cultures, although toxic to assayed G. mellonella larvae, did not inhibit mite oviposition to the degree or duration of the exudate preparations. These findings suggest that the factor responsible for suppressing oviposition in female spider mites is linked to the sporulation process and is distinct from the well-characterized HtA produced by vegetative cells.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that certain taxonomic groups are more thoroughly studied than others across a wide range of biological disciplines. Such taxonomic biases have the potential to define our understanding of theory, and limit the generality of our insights. To assess the distribution of taxonomic representation in current and historical animal behaviour research, we constructed a data set containing article metrics and taxonomic information for all research articles published in the journal Animal Behaviour between 1953 and 2015. We found significant taxonomic bias, with chordate papers making up 70\% of all publications in the past 15 years, despite accounting for less than 7\% of all animal species. Within chordates, Animal Behaviour content is biased towards endotherms, with birds and mammals comprising more than 50\% of all publications. In sum, six animal orders account for more than half of all publications, with the most commonly published order, Passeriformes, representing one in five articles. Our findings confirm that a relatively narrow group of ‘model’ taxa represent the vast majority of articles, and may have a disproportionate influence on our understanding of behavioural patterns and processes. Furthermore, we find evidence of a citation bias, with chordate studies receiving on average four citations more per paper than arthropod studies. While historical trends suggest that the publication gap between arthropods and chordates has been shrinking for the past 45 years, our findings show that a considerable bias still remains. These biases may originate from human preferences for certain animal types, but we argue that they are likely maintained by a mixture of taxonomic prejudices, cultural aspects of behavioural ecology as a field, and of academia in general. We suggest that the patterns are clear and their implications serious, and that it is time that both researchers and journals give serious consideration to addressing them.}

Adult mites were confined to arenas prepared with citrus leaves in acrylic dishes containing agar–water.

The H. thompsonii isolates caused higher mortality, with indices higher than 90\%. Observations under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) were performed at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h after application of a H. thompsonii suspension containing 107 conidia/ml. Twenty-four hours after inoculation, H. thompsonii conidia were observed attached to the mite’s integument. The conidia germinated and penetrated through the base of the setae on the hysterosoma. Colonization occurred after 48 h, as evidenced by mortality. Conidiogenesis occurred after 120 h, with the development of mycelium and conidiophores emerging from the posterior and anterior parts of the mite.},

In this test, four treatments were tried: H. thompsonii cultured on rice (APC) at two concentrations (20 kg/ha and 10 kg/ha), H. thompsonii produced by liquid fermentation (MC-L) (5 L/ha) and control (sterile water). Adult survival, number of eggs and nymphs per fruit were observed 10 and 20 days after the fungus application. The lowest LC25 value calculated was from pathogen produced in MC-S (1.9 x 10(5) conidia/ml).The LC25 values calculated to APC and APC-SM did not differ statistically. The LC25 values to MC-L and MC-S were 1.9 x 10(6) infective cells/ml and 2.2 x 10(5) conidia/ml. In the field, concentration and time to death differed between treatments and control.

  abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB; also known as citrus greening) is severely reducing global citrus production. HLB is a bacterial disorder caused by the vector-transmitted pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), and, as of today, it is one of the most destructive diseases facing the citrus industry of Florida and beyond. HLB in Florida was first detected in 2005 and is now widely distributed throughout the commercial citrus-growing regions in the state. Preliminary studies have found that root systems of HLB-tolerant rootstocks show less damage in response to CLas infection, whereas marked injury is evident soon after infection of susceptible material. An HLB-damaged root system has poor nutrient uptake capacity, which leads to nutrient deficiencies and impairs tree performance. As of today, plant mechanisms of HLB-tolerance are still unclear and there is no cure for HLB and root structure–function relationships remain an understudied component of the responses and may play a key role in tolerance. This review summarised all the recent studies on soil and root health of HLB-affected citrus. Better understanding of how roots and soils are affected by HLB can potentially lead to improved management practices.},

To date, attempts to develop an artificial diet for ACP have focused solely on the adult life stage, ignoring the juvenile stages. We developed a feeding system and artificial diet that is compatible with the juvenile stages of ACP and tested growth rates when exposed to varying concentrations of sucrose and amino acids. We found a surprisingly high tolerance for high sucrose concentrations in ACP when compared to known tolerances of sucrose concentrations in other phloem-feeding insects. This is indicative that ACP may be physiologically adapted to a broad range of sucrose concentrations and osmotic stresses. The growth rate of juvenile ACP was optimized when amino acids were in a global concentration of 150 mM, with higher concentrations not appreciably impacting growth. This finding corresponds with the optimal amino acid concentrations required in other phloem feeders, notably the pea aphid. The development of this feeding system, with the diet optimized for growth, will allow for future experiments to be undertaken into the uptake of CLas by the psyllid and into the nutritional requirements of ACP. This feeding system will also allow for physiological comparisons among the phloem-feeding insects.},

For many years, Trioza erytreae (Del Guercio) (Hemiptera: Triozidae) was known to be the main vector of the African citrus greening disease caused by Candidatus Liberibacter africanus (CLaf), but the recent arrival of D. citri on the continent adds to the dynamics of infection and spread of both diseases on mainland Africa.

Conidial germination was tested in three vegetable oils (sunflower, olive and maize) at two concentrations (1\% and 10\%) to evaluate their compatibility for further liquid formulations. According to radial growth and germination results, we selected four isolates to test their pathogenicity against second instar B. tabaci nymphs with the selected oil formulations at 30°C. CEP381 and CEP401 showed the highest radial growth. Isolates CEP381, CEP401, CEP413 and CEP409 (Metarhizium spp.) had similar germination percentages as compared with water control when germinated on either sunflower, olive or maize oils at 10\% v/v. The highest mortality of B. tabaci was observed for the isolates CEP381 in sunflower oil and CEP401 in olive oil. Molecular identification of isolates was performed using ITS4–5 primers. All isolates belong to the Metarhizium core group. Tested isolates could grow and infect B. tabaci nymphs at 30°C in some of the vegetable oils as carriers, providing new possibilities for integrated pest management of Bemisia tabaci.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The deterrent effect of seven commercial compounds against Schistocerca americana (Drury) nymphs and Diaprepes abbreviatus L. adults, two important citrus pests, was investigated. Extracts of three Florida local plants were also tested as deterrents. Antifeedant activity was assayed using a leaf-disk bioassay in choice and no-choice tests. The residual activity of the commercial compounds that significantly deterred the insects was assayed by applying them to foliage of citrus plants exposed to three time intervals of sunlight. RESULTS: Sabadilla, azadirachtin and ryanodine effectively deterred S. americana, whereas rotenone, sabadilla and ryanodine reduced the feeding activity of D. abbreviatus. Methanol and methylene chloride extracts of Ceratiola ericoides Michaux deterred D. abbreviatus, but only methylene chloride extract dissuaded S. americana. Methanol extract of Ardisia crenata Sims functioned as a feeding deterrent against both S. americana and D. abbreviatus, but only the latter species was deterred by methylene chloride extract of A. crenata. Extracts of Illicium parviflorum Michaux ex Ventetat only dissuaded the insects in choice bioassays. Rapid loss of effectiveness was observed under field conditions. Sabadilla was the only compound that maintained its antifeedant properties in the field, but only against S. americana. CONCLUSION: Based on their deterrency, some of the commercial products and plant extracts have potential for use as substitute crop protectants against the pest species tested.

  abstract = {Phytopathogens and herbivores induce plant defences. Whereas there is evidence that some pathogens suppress these defences by interfering with signalling pathways involved in the defence, such evidence is scarce for herbivores. We found that the invasive spider mite Tetranychus evansi suppresses the induction of the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalling routes involved in induced plant defences in tomato. This was reflected in the levels of inducible defence compounds, such as proteinase inhibitors, which in mite-infested plants were reduced to even lower levels than the constitutive levels in herbivore-free plants. Additionally, the spider mite suppressed the release of inducible volatiles, which are implicated in plant defence. Consequently, the mites performed much better on previously attacked plants than on non-attacked plants. These findings provide a new perspective on plant–herbivore interactions, plant protection and plant resistance to invasive species.},

In a previous study, the taxonomic status of A. tosichella in Australia was assessed using molecular markers. A. tosichella was shown to consist of two genetically distinct lineages likely to represent different species. Here we show that both lineages occupy similar distributions, occurring throughout the entire Australian wheat belt, and that the lineages are often found in sympatry. CLIMEX analysis suggests that tolerance to heat and desiccation limit the distribution of A. tosichella. In the laboratory, only one WCM lineage transmitted WSMV virus under controlled conditions. These results have implications for the management of WCM and WSMV within Australia.},

Leaf surfaces have various structures, such as trichomes and domatia, which add to the complexity of the microenvironment experienced by arthropods. Plant structure can affect the retention and performance of predators and parasitoids and it has been proposed that phylloplane characteristics be modified to improve the utility of these organisms as biological control agents. Phytoseiids have a long history as biological control agents of pest mite species in agricultural systems. In the past 30 years, extensive research has shown that trichomes and domatia influence phytoseiid populations and performance. Various reasons have been proposed to explain this relationship, including increased pollen capture for use as a food source, escape from predation, avoidance of adverse abiotic conditions, and increased/decreased ease of prey capture. There is potential for the manipulation of crops to improve biological control by phytoseiids, but incorporating beneficial traits into plants is likely to have lower priority than other breeding characteristics. The objectives of this review are to summarize the evidence for the relationship between phytoseiids and leaf surface structures, discuss possible hypotheses to explain this relationship, examine the potential of altering current crop varieties for the purpose of increasing phytoseiid populations or performance, and conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the effects of plant surface structures on phytoseiid and phytophagous mite densities.},

Consequently, insect rearing received increasing attention during the twentieth century and was explicitly recognized as a profession by Dickerson and Leppla (1992). In spite of this recognition, until the twenty-first century, insect rearing professionals received nearly all their training informally by working in insect rearing programs, networking with other professionals, studying insect rearing manuals and literature (e.g., Singh and Moore 1985, Anderson and Leppla 1992), participating in symposia at scientific conferences (e.g., annual meetings of the Entomological Society of America), visiting insectaries, and through trial and error (Cohen 2001). During the past 18 years, however, the demand for formal insect rearing education and training has been addressed primarily at two U.S. institutions: North Carolina State University and Mississippi State University.},

Traps were constructed with a cage attached to an inverted funnel. An attractant used in the traps was from a chloroform extract of weevil frass. Trap location was a highly significant factor in weevil capture in a 4-m-high citrus tree. Traps in the top (4.3 m above ground) captured 349 weevils, those in the middle captured 138, and those at a low level (0.3 m above ground) captured 19 weevils. Top and middle traps also captured significantly more male than female weevils (2.8:1). Presence of the attractant significantly increased weevil capture per trap compared with traps with no attractant. Significantly more weevils were captured in traps when glass wool rather than cotton or rubber was used as the wick material for release of the attractant.},

  abstract = {Plant morphological traits such as leaf pubescence may affect herbivores and their natural enemies at the individual, population and community levels. Leaf pubescence has been repeatedly shown to mediate predator-herbivore interactions whereas the influence of leaf pubescence on predator–predator interactions such as intraguild predation (IGP) has seldom been investigated. Using a three-pronged approach we assessed the influence of leaf pubescence on the predatory mites Kampimodromus aberrans and Euseius finlandicus. Both predators occur on broad-leaved trees in Europe. Euseius finlandicus is mostly found on trees with glabrous leaves whereas K. aberrans mainly occurs on trees with pubescent leaves. We hypothesized that leaf pubescence mediates IGP between K. aberrans and E. finlandicus and thereby determines their dominance and proportional abundance. A field survey on apple revealed that the abundance of K. aberrans and E. finlandicus is negatively correlated, with the former predominating on cultivars with strongly pubescent leaves and the latter predominating on cultivars with little pubescent or glabrous leaves. Microhabitat choice tests showed that K. aberrans preferentially resides on pubescent leaves whereas E. finlandicus preferentially resides on glabrous leaves. The effects of leaf pubescence on survival and development of immature IG predators and IG prey were reversed for K. aberrans and E. finlandicus. In the presence of the IG predator E. finlandicus, immature K. aberrans had higher survival probabilities on pubescent leaves than on glabrous ones. In contrast, the survival chances of immature E. finlandicus were higher on glabrous leaves than on pubescent ones when the IG predator K. aberrans was present. Artificial leaf pubescence enhanced IG prey capture by immature K. aberrans and prolonged their longevity but impaired IG prey capture by immature E. finlandicus and shortened their longevity. We conclude that leaf pubescence mediates IGP strength and symmetry and discuss the implications to natural and biological control.},

Adult D. citri preferentially selected young shoots for feeding and numbers of D. citri immatures were positively correlated with flush shoot softness. Young flush shoots had higher concentrations of macro and micro nutrients relative to mature ones and this was associated with higher densities of all D. citri life stages. All D. citri life stages were positively correlated with higher nitrogen-carbon (N:C), nitrogen:sulfur (N:S) and nitrogen:calcium (N:Ca) ratios in leaf tissue, while densities of adults were negatively related to calcium, manganese and boron levels. Concentrations of total and essential amino acids were highest in phloem sap of young expanding flush shoots in both grapefruit and lemon, but dramatically declined as flush shoots matured. The sulfur-containing amino acids cystine, methionine and taurine occurred only in younger flush shoots. In contrast, cystathionine was only present in phloem sap of mature shoots. These results clearly indicate that young citrus flush shoots are a nutritionally richer diet relative to mature shoots, thus explaining their preference by D. citri for feeding and reproduction. Conversely, tissue hardness and the lower nutritional quality of mature flush shoots may limit oviposition and immature development. The data suggest that both physical characteristics and nutritional composition of flush shoots and their phloem sap are important factors regulating host colonization and behavior of D. citri, and this interaction can impact the dynamics and spread of HLB in citrus groves.},

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, a vector of citrus huanglongbing, is now present in all citrus-producing states in the USA and Mexico. In addition to citrus, the insect can reproduce on several other plant species in the Rutaceae family; orange jasmine (Murraya spp.) and curry leaf (Bergera koenigii) are among its preferred hosts. There are several indigenous Rutaceae species in North America, and some are popular ornamentals. A study was therefore initiated to determine the suitability of some of these plants for feeding and development of the psyllid in choice and no-choice experiments. D. citri was found to reproduce successfully on Choisya ternata, C. arizonica and Helietta parvifolia in no-choice tests, but preferentially selected orange jasmine and curry leaf for feeding and reproduction, in choice tests. On Amyris madrensis, A. texana and Zanthoxylum fagara, adult psyllids laid eggs which hatched, but no successful nymphal development was recorded beyond the first instars. No oviposition was recorded on Esenbeckia berlandieri, Ptelea trifoliata and Casimiroa tetrameria, although adult psyllids were able to survive on these species for several days. Results showed that C. ternata, C. arizonica and H. parvifolia can serve host plants of D. citri and this constitutes the first report of these plants serving as host for D. citri. The findings of the present study suggest that native rutaceous host plants can serve as host plants and thus affect D. citri population dynamics and the epidemiology of Huanglongbing, the deadly citrus greening disease whose pathogen is vectored by D. citri. Thus, area-wide management of this pest also should target these riparian habitats where these host plants are present with D. citri biological control agents for sustainable management of this pest.},

  abstract = {Citrus grove colonization by the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) starts from border trees. This behaviour can be exploited by placing barriers along grove borders to prevent psyllid incursion and thwart population establishment and growth. We tested the effects of psyllid-­resistant mesh fencing along grove borders for season-­ long control of D. citri populations. Deployment of sticky cards at different heights revealed that most D. citri ({$>$}99\%) were collected on traps placed at or below 3.7 m along grove border. Thus, psyllid-­resistant mesh fencing (3.7 m in height) was installed along the eastern and southern borders of a 3-­year-­old grapefruit grove to protect against D. citri infestations, while the west and north edges were left unprotected. A similar adjacent grove with no border fencing served as untreated control. A reduction of 55\%–98\% of D. citri numbers was observed in the grove with border fences relative to the untreated control. D. citri density reductions were more pronounced on the sides with border fences suggesting that the observed effects were due to the mesh fencing. Thus, border mesh fencing as a standalone approach or coupled with other management strategies, such as border sprays, could be an effective psyllid management strategy. The season-­long benefits of border fences are not limited to D. citri population control, but also significant reductions of insecticide input and nontarget effects, thus substantially mitigating the risks of secondary pest outbreaks and ensuring the sustainability of D. citri management in citrus groves.},

HLB is putatively caused by Candidatus Liberibacter spp. (Rhizobiales: Phyllopbacteriaceae) that are transmitted to citrus by psyllid vectors. Diaphorina citri population monitoring is done to detect its presence and inform on management decisions. Various methods are used for detecting and estimating D. citri densities but trapping with yellow or lime-green sticky cards has proven to be the most effective method. These sticky cards rely on the color preference of adult D. citri, but many flying organisms are attracted to the same color spectrum as psyllids. Hence, in field situations, sticky traps are hampered by large numbers of bycatches of nontarget organisms and debris. Here, we described a method using a mesh laid on the surface of traps as a sift to catch mainly psyllids, while reducing bycatches. By filtering D. citri through this mesh, they can be counted more rapidly and accurately. Although mesh-covered traps captured 5–15\% less D. citri relative to uncovered ACP traps, both types of traps statistically agreed on D. citri detection and population densities. The effectiveness of mesh-covered traps did not vary with season. In addition, mesh-covered traps eliminated ¿90\% of nontarget organisms and allowed for quicker enumeration of D. citri. We expect this method will become an important component of redesigning integrated pest management programs in citrus groves by reducing unintended impacts of beneficial arthropods during large scale D. citri monitoring.}

Diaphorina citri the vector of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, the causal agent of Huanglongbing feeds on citrus in both habitats. We postulated that residential citrus function as a ‘source’ of D. citri that infest groves, functioning as sinks. Here we report on an experimental mark-release-recapture study conducted at the interface of a residential neighborhood and groves. Adult D. citri marked with colored fluorescent powders were released in both habitats (n = 15,300) and their movement within and between milieus monitored. Although the recapture rate of marked psyllids was very low (0.23\%), the results were instructive. Most of the recaptured psyllids in residential trees (84.6\%) were released within that habitat. In contrast, approximately half of the marked psyllids recovered in groves were released in residential areas. Of all the recaptured psyllids, about 40\% changed habitats, but the change was skewed toward movement from residential to grove habitat. These data strongly suggest that there is a constant exchange of D. citri adults between the two habitats, with residential citrus trees functioning as a source habitat of psyllids. The further the residential trees are located from groves, the less likely they will serve as sources of D. citri. Hence, to reduce the risks of citrus grove colonization by D. citri, new groves should be established away from residential habitats where possible, and psyllid management practices must also be implemented in residential habitats.},

The ability of plants to tolerate salt stress is determined by multiple biochemical and molecular pathways. Here we discuss physiological, biochemical, and cellular modulations in plants in response to salt stress. Knowledge of these modulations can assist in assessing salt tolerance potential and the mechanisms underlying salinity tolerance in plants. Salinity-induced cellular damage is highly correlated with generation of reactive oxygen species, ionic imbalance, osmotic damage, and reduced relative water content. Accelerated antioxidant activities and osmotic adjustment by the formation of organic and inorganic osmolytes are significant and effective salinity tolerance mechanisms for crop plants. In addition, polyamines improve salt tolerance by regulating various physiological mechanisms, including rhizogenesis, somatic embryogenesis, maintenance of cell pH, and ionic homeostasis. This research project focuses on three strategies to augment salinity tolerance capacity in agricultural crops: salinity-induced alterations in signaling pathways; signaling of phytohormones, ion channels, and biosensors; and expression of ion transporter genes in crop plants (especially in comparison to halophytes).},

  abstract = {Plants have a perception system triggered by pathogen and pest signals to initiate defense. These signals include evolutionarily conserved molecules from microbes and insects termed pathogen/herbivore-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/HAMPs). Here we showed that hexaacetyl-chitohexaose (HC), an oligosaccharide from chitin, a structural component in insect exoskeletons and fungi cell walls, upregulated defense-associated genes WRKY22, GST1, RAR1, EDS1, PAL1 and NPR2, and downregulated ICS1 at 1\,h after HC treatment in Sun Chu Sha mandarin leaves. The effect was transient as defense gene transcriptional changes were not observed at 18\,h after the treatment. Electrical penetration graph (EPG) recordings were used to study the feeding behavior of Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) following the HC treatment. ACP is the hemipteran vector of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), the pathogen associated with huanglongbing (HLB). Adult ACP displayed reduced intercellular probing, reduced xylem feeding count and duration, and increased non-probing activity on HC-treated citrus compared to controls. During an 18-h recording, percentage for total duration of xylem ingestion, phloem ingestion, intercellular probing were lower, and the percentage of non-probing behavior was higher in HC-treated leaves than in controls. In host-selection behavior studies, HC treatment did not alter the attractiveness of citrus leaves under light or dark conditions. In addition, ACP feeding on HC-treated leaves did not show differences in mortality for up to 10\,day of exposure. In summary, we report that HC induced a transient defense in citrus and an inhibitory effect on ACP feeding but did not affect host selection or the insect fitness under the tested conditions.},

  abstract = {Slow-release sachets of predatory mites are commercially available for controlling small pest arthropods in many crops. We recently developed plant-attached shelters containing sachets and felt patches, called “sheltered sachets”, to protect predators against pesticides and wet conditions, and enhance their release to crops. However, this release system appeared to be vulnerable to dry ambient environments. To address this problem, we developed “moisturized sheltered sachets”, containing water-absorbed polymers as a humidifier, and investigated the numbers of Neoseiulus californicus and Amblyseius swirskii released from three different release systems, at low, moderate, and high RH. Irrespective of predator species and RH (excepting A. swirskii at high RH), more predators were released from the moisturized sheltered sachets than from the sheltered sachets and/or normal sachets. Thus, moisturized sheltered sachets appear to be potentially useful for the efficient predator release in a wide range of humidity environments.},

  abstract = {The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is a serious threat to citrus production because it transmits the bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus Jagoueix (Hyphomicrobiales: Rhizobiaceae), that causes huanglongbing. Currently, there is no cure for huanglongbing, and vector management is implemented to reduce the spread of pathogen. In Florida, calendar-based insecticide application had been used widely for D. citri management, but the evolution of insecticide resistance in D. citri and associated reductions of natural enemy populations mandate more sustainable approaches. The objective of our study was to compare the effects of organic management versus intermittent use of conventional insecticides on population suppression of D. citri by natural enemies in Florida. We conducted a survey of natural enemies in citrus groves that were managed organically versus intermittently treated with conventional insecticides from Mar to Dec 2019. We also compared mortality of D. citri in those groves by deploying sentinel psyllids on leaf flush with or without exclusion cages. The abundance of natural enemies was recorded by visual observations made on tree branches for 2 min intervals. Finally, we estimated tree flush density and monitored adult D. citri populations. Survival of sentinel D. citri was significantly lower on uncaged flush when natural enemies had access to eggs and nymphs during spring, summer, and fall in organic groves; however, such a difference was not observed between caged and uncaged D. citri in intermittently sprayed groves, particularly during summer and fall. Similarly, organic sites had lower numbers of adult D. citri compared to intermittently sprayed sites throughout most of the sampling period, suggesting that natural enemies contributed to regulation of D. citri populations in organic groves more so than in the intermittently treated conventional groves. The most common natural enemies found were Coccinellidae, Chrysopidae, Formicidae, Eulophidae, Syrphidae, Dolichopodidae, and Arachnida. Among these groups, formicids were most abundant in organic groves, whereas dolichopodids and coccinellids were most abundant in intermittently managed groves. Our results suggest that intermittent spraying for D. citri with conventional insecticides could affect activity of natural enemies even though such practices did not entirely eliminate their populations.},

Strangers in Paradise provides an in-depth examination of the Florida experience and of the ongoing efforts to eradicate or manage introduced species. Chapters consider: natural disturbance and the spread of nonindigenous species case studies of insects, freshwater invertebrates, fishes, amphibians and reptiles, birds, marine invertebrates and algae, and mammals methods of managing nonindigenous species including ecological restoration, eradication, "maintenance control," and biological control management on public lands the regulatory framework including the role of the federal government as well as state authorities and responsibilities Strangers in Paradise is the first comprehensive volume to address a large, diverse region and the full range of nonindigenous species, the problems they cause, and the methods and impediments to dealing with them. Throughout, contributors emphasize solutions and relate the situation in Florida to problems faced by other states, making the book an important guide for anyone involved with control and management of invasive species.},

It was accidentally introduced from the Caribbean into Florida in the 1960s and its range within the United States now includes Texas and California. No safe and effective control method is available for this species. Studies of the reproductive behavior of field populations may aid the development of effective control strategies and inform laboratory experimental design. We examined mating patterns of individually-marked D. abbreviatus in a plant nursery in Florida over 5 d. Matings occurred throughout the day but tended to peak during the middle of the day. Mating duration ranged from less than 3 h to over 9 h. Most males and females mated repeatedly, sometimes with the same partner multiple times. Both same-sex and extra-pair mountings occurred at low frequencies. In a follow-up study conducted in captivity, we found no short-term direct benefits of multiple mating to females but female fertility decreased dramatically by 2 weeks after mating if females were not allowed to re-mate. Thus, female D. abbreviatus may re-mate, in part, to replenish sperm stores. Our results suggest that the sterile insect technique would not be effective but support previous conclusions that pheromones may be effective attractants in this species because both females and males mate multiple times in the field.},

Diaphorina citri, the vector of citrus greening disease, were reared on propagated orange jasmine (Murraya paniculata (L.) Jack) because it is not considered a host of the greening pathogen Liberobacter asiaticum and is more resistant to psyllid feeding damage than citrus. Each month, approximately 36,000 D. citri nymphs could be generated, yielding 6750 T. radiata and 1630 D. aligarhensis after 180 h of labor, and use of 150 M. paniculata plants, 20 m 2 of greenhouse space, and 18 m 2 of quarantine space. The developmental time from psyllid egg to the start of parasitoid emergence was 24 days for T. radiata and 28 days for D. aligarhensis. The sex ratio of laboratory-reared T. radiata was 1.8 \$:1\# (n ¼ 400) in the Taiwanese population and 2.0 \$:1\# (n ¼ 400) in the Vietnamese population.

  abstract = {The cereal rust mite Abacarus hystrix (Nalepa), a significant pest of grasses, has been regarded as one of a few exceptions among eriophyoid mites with reference to the pattern of host plant utilization. At least 60 grass species have been recorded as its hosts. Thus, the mite has long been considered as a host generalist in which host specialization would not be likely to evolve. However, recent studies have revealed that host-associated specialization is possible in A. hystrix. Here, we aimed to discriminate between the three populations of A. hystrix associated with the different hosts (namely quackgrass, ryegrass and smooth brome) on the basis of mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear (D2 region of 28S rDNA) DNA sequences. The phylogenetic trees obtained with the maximum likelihood analysis of both COI and D2 region data sets showed that host-adapted strains of A. hystrix form distinct clades. Furthermore, on the COI nucleotide tree, the quackgrass- and brome-associated strains were internally divided each into two well-supported monophyletic clusters. The nucleotide D2 region data set tree showed that brome-associated strain is polyphyletic in origin. There is clear co-variation of DNA results with earlier morphological and ecological traits, as well as the results of crossing experiments. We showed that reproductively incompatible strains of A. hystrix exhibit more than 20\% sequence divergence in the COI gene and 0.2\% sequence divergence in the D2 28S rDNA. Our results did not confirm the placement of three host-associated strains of A. hystrix within one, ostensibly generalist, species.},

  abstract = {Significance Herbivore attack on plants is known to elicit defensive responses. Such environmentally induced responses can also be expressed by the offspring of attacked plants via DNA methylation—an epigenetic response—but little is known about if and how epigenetic induction varies with plant ontogeny (e.g., seedlings, reproductive plants). Here, we report that herbivory by caterpillars induced changes in the plant epigenome and chemical and physical defenses within and across generations in wild radish. We show that herbivore offense in a plant’s generation affects its progeny’s deployment of defenses throughout its life cycle and that herbivory operates as an important and nuanced driver of phenotypic diversity in plant populations. Abstract As they develop, many plants deploy shifts in antiherbivore defense allocation due to changing costs and benefits of their defensive traits. Plant defenses are known to be primed or directly induced by herbivore damage within generations and across generations by long-lasting epigenetic mechanisms. However, little is known about the differences between life stages of epigenetically inducible defensive traits across generations. To help fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a multigenerational experiment to determine whether defense induction in wild radish plants was reflected in chromatin modifications (DNA methylation); we then examined differences between seedlings and reproductive plants in current and transgenerational plasticity in chemical (glucosinolates) and physical (trichomes) defenses in this species. Herbivory triggered genome methylation both in targeted plants and their offspring. Within one generation, both defenses were highly inducible at the seedling stage, but only chemical defenses were inducible in reproductive plants. Across generations, herbivory experienced by mother plants caused strong direct induction of physical defenses in their progeny, with effects lasting from seedling to reproductive stages. For chemical defenses, however, this transgenerational induction was evident only in adults. Transgenerational priming was observed in physical and chemical defenses, particularly in adult plants. Our results show that transgenerational plasticity in plant defenses in response to herbivore offense differs for physical and chemical defense and changes across plant life stages.}

  date = {2011},
  abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) is regarded as the most devastating disease of citrus worldwide. Countries  infected with HLB either no longer produce citrus commercially or have had to relocate their  industries to different geographic regions to avoid the disease. Because citrus is such an  important part of the Florida economy, and the state is surrounded by water, neither of these  strategies were viable options. Thus, efforts have been ongoing to find ways to maintain the  health and productivity of existing mature trees in Florida until a long-term cure is developed.  Our data, as well as the data of other researchers, shows that HLB-infected trees are consistently  deficient in Ca, Mg, Mn, Zn, and B; and, in a grove setting, these nutrient deficient trees are  more likely to be HLB-infected than the nutrient sufficient trees. It is not yet known whether  these deficiencies are a result of decreased nutrient uptake or if the nutrients are being bound  within the plant making them unavailable. These findings are important because mineral  nutrients function as inhibitors, activators, and regulators of plant and pathogen physiological  processes. For example, Ca and B are important nutrients for the development, maintenance, and  integrity of cell walls. Plants deficient in Ca and B have higher levels of free sugars and amino  acids in the apoplast and phloem sap – compounds needed by many pathogens and insect pests.  Mg is important for protein synthesis through its role in the aggregation of ribosome subunits.  Under Mg deficiency, protein synthesis stops and free amino acid content increases.  A commercial citrus grove in Florida has been maintaining HLB-infected trees for nearly 5 years  through an aggressive foliar nutrition and psyllid control program. These results have been  replicated in three other locations within the state for 2 years. Overall tree health, yield, and fruit  quality of HLB-infected trees under this management program will be discussed.},

During feeding they release chemical cues that allow plants to detect the attack and mount an efficient defense response. A signaling cascade triggers the expression of hundreds of genes, which encode defensive proteins and enzymes for synthesis of toxic metabolites. This direct defense is often complemented by emission of volatiles that attract beneficial parasitoids. In return, arthropods have evolved strategies to interfere with plant defenses, either by producing effectors to inhibit detection and downstream signaling steps, or by adapting to their detrimental effect. In this review, we address the current knowledge on the molecular and chemical dialog between plants and herbivores, with an emphasis on co-evolutionary aspects.},

  abstract = {Applied research on host-plant resistance to arthropod pests has been guided over the past 60 years by a framework originally developed by Reginald Painter in his 1951 book, Insect Resistance in Crop Plants. Painter divided the “phenomena” of resistance into three “mechanisms,” nonpreference (later renamed antixenosis), antibiosis, and tolerance. The weaknesses of this framework are discussed. In particular, this trichotomous framework does not encompass all known mechanisms of resistance, and the antixenosis and antibiosis categories are ambiguous and inseparable in practice. These features have perhaps led to a simplistic approach to understanding arthropod resistance in crop plants. A dichotomous scheme is proposed as a replacement, with a major division between resistance (plant traits that limit injury to the plant) and tolerance (plant traits that reduce amount of yield loss per unit injury), and the resistance category subdivided into constitutive/inducible and direct/indirect subcategories. The most important benefits of adopting this dichotomous scheme are to more closely align the basic and applied literatures on plant resistance and to encourage a more mechanistic approach to studying plant resistance in crop plants. A more mechanistic approach will be needed to develop novel approaches for integrating plant resistance into pest management programs.},

The results indicate that BTH treatment led to enhanced activities of β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase in the intercellular spaces of rose leaves. An increase in extracellular β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase activities was also found in D. rosae-infected leaves. However, the increase in enzyme activities occurred much more rapidly and was more strongly enhanced in D. rosae-infected leaves that were previously treated with BTH, suggesting that the increased β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase may play a role in restricting the development of disease symptoms on the rose leaves infected with D. rosae. The expression patterns of rose β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase isoforms were investigated on native PAGE with specific staining techniques. A similar induction pattern of these enzymes was observed in both treatments. The increased β-1,3-glucanase and chitinase activities are mainly due to the enhanced expression of β-1,3-glucanase isoform G2 and chitinase isoforms C1 and C2. These isoforms are likely to be a part of rose defense responses to pathogen attack.}

Excessive application of insecticides has detrimental impacts on human health, environment and long-term sustainability. One particular area of interest is in exploring how insects are attracted to specific bands of the visible light spectrum. This paper details the study of several light conditions using Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) to determine its phototaxis response on the common grasshopper, garden moth and lava beetle. The results conclude that all three insects exhibit positive phototaxis response on wavelengths around 491nm and below, which encompasses ultraviolet, blue and green. The radiant intensity experiment revealed a threshold response of 2.8mW/m2, or 25m in reciprocal distance.},

  abstract = {Studies examining interspecific differences in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) typically assume that the degree of sexual differences in body size is invariable within species. This work was conducted to assess validity of this assumption. As a result of a systematic literature survey, datasets for 158 insect species were retrieved. Each dataset contained adult or pupal weights of males and females for two or more different subsets, typically originating from different conditions during immature development. For each species, an analysis was conducted to examine dependence of SSD on body size, the latter variable being used as a proxy of environmental quality. A considerable variation in SSD was revealed at the intraspecific level in insects. The results suggest that environmental conditions may strongly affect the degree, though not the direction of SSD within species. In most species, female size appeared to be more sensitive to environmental conditions than male size: with conditions improving, there was a larger relative increase in female than male size. As a consequence, sexual differences in size were shown to increase with increasing body size in species with female-biased SSD (females were the larger sex in more than 80\% of the species examined). The results were consistent across different insect orders and ecological subdivisions. Mechanisms leading to intraspecific variation in SSD are discussed. This study underlines the need to consider intraspecific variation in SSD in comparative studies.},

  abstract = {1. The negative effect of induced plant resistance on the preference and performance of herbivores is a well-documented ecological phenomenon that is thought to be important for both plants and herbivores. This study links the well-developed mechanistic understanding of the biochemistry of induced plant resistance in the tomato system with an examination of how these mechanisms affect the community of herbivores in the field. 2. Several proteins that are induced in tomato foliage following herbivore damage have been linked causally to reductions in herbivore performance under laboratory conditions. Application of jasmonic acid, a natural elicitor of these defensive proteins, to tomato foliage stimulates induced responses to herbivory. 3. Jasmonic acid was sprayed on plants in three doses to generate plants with varying levels of induced responses, which were measured as increases in the activities of proteinase inhibitors and polyphenol oxidase. 4. Field experiments conducted over 3\textbackslash hspace1emyears indicated that induction of these defensive proteins is associated with decreases in the abundance of all four naturally abundant herbivores, including insects in three feeding guilds, caterpillars, flea beetles, aphids, and thrips. Induced resistance killed early instars of noctuid caterpillars. Adult flea beetles strongly preferred control plants over induced plants, and this effect on host plant preference probably contributed to differences in the natural abundance of flea beetles. 5. The general nature of the effects observed in this study suggests that induced resistance will suppress many members of the herbivore community. By linking plant biochemistry, insect preference, performance, and abundance, tools can be developed to manipulate plant resistance sensibly and to predict its outcome under field conditions.},

In response to attack, plants evolved highly effective, inducible defense systems. Two plant hormones modulating inducible defenses are salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Current thinking is that SA induces resistance against biotrophic pathogens and some phloem feeding insects and JA induces resistance against necrotrophic pathogens, some phloem feeding insects and chewing herbivores. Signaling crosstalk between SA and JA commonly manifests as a reciprocal antagonism and may be adaptive, but this remains speculative. We examine evidence for and against adaptive explanations for antagonistic crosstalk, trace its phylogenetic origins and provide a hypothesis-testing framework for future research on the adaptive significance of SA–JA crosstalk.},

Although most psyllids, including D. citri, confine breeding to a narrow range of usually related host plants, the adults will feed and obtain nutrition from a wider array of plants (Hodkinson 1974). The Asian citrus psyllid prefers Citrus spp. and all breeding host plants are in the family Rutaceae (reviewed by Halbert \& Manjunath 2004). Feeding could spread the disease agent to non-citrus plants that might then serve as reservoirs of the disease in nature. A mitigating factor is that only the immature stages of the psyllid can effectively acquire and host the bacteria (Pelz-Stelinski et al. 2010), and thus, any plant species that serve as breeding hosts are of primary concern in that regard.}

  abstract = {Over the last 25 years, research on biodiversity has expanded dramatically, fuelled by increasing threats to the natural world. However, the number of published studies is heavily weighted towards certain taxa, perhaps influencing conservation awareness of and funding for less-popular groups. Few studies have systematically quantified these biases, although information on this topic is important for informing future research and conservation priorities. We investigated: i) which animal taxa are being studied; ii) if any taxonomic biases are the same in temperate and tropical regions; iii) whether the taxon studied is named in the title of papers on biodiversity, perhaps reflecting a perception of what biodiversity is; iv) the geographical distribution of biodiversity research, compared with the distribution of biodiversity and threatened species; and v) the geographical distribution of authors’ countries of origin. To do this, we used the search engine Web of Science to systematically sample a subset of the published literature with ‘biodiversity’ in the title. In total 526 research papers were screened—5\% of all papers in Web of Science with biodiversity in the title. For each paper, details on taxonomic group, title phrasing, number of citations, study location, and author locations were recorded. Compared to the proportions of described species, we identified a considerable taxonomic weighting towards vertebrates and an under-representation of invertebrates (particularly arachnids and insects) in the published literature. This discrepancy is more pronounced in highly cited papers, and in tropical regions, with only 43\% of biodiversity research in the tropics including invertebrates. Furthermore, while papers on vertebrate taxa typically did not specify the taxonomic group in the title, the converse was true for invertebrate papers. Biodiversity research is also biased geographically: studies are more frequently carried out in developed countries with larger economies, and for a given level of species or threatened species, tropical countries were understudied relative to temperate countries. Finally, biodiversity research is disproportionately authored by researchers from wealthier countries, with studies less likely to be carried out by scientists in lower-GDP nations. Our results highlight the need for a more systematic and directed evaluation of biodiversity studies, perhaps informing more targeted research towards those areas and taxa most depauperate in research. Only by doing so can we ensure that biodiversity research yields results that are relevant and applicable to all regions and that the information necessary for the conservation of threatened species is available to conservation practitioners.},

  abstract = {Infection of Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), with ‘Candidatus’ Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), the causal pathogen of citrus greening disease or huanglongbing, increases psyllid susceptibility to insecticides. Diaphorina citri populations in citrus occur year-round in tropical and sub-tropical habitats, and thus insecticide applications for managing this plant disease vector occur over a wide temperature range (10–40 °C). During the winter season, D. citri is occasionally exposed to periods of freezing temperatures, when temperatures fall below −6.5 °C. In this investigation, we compared insecticide susceptibility of uninfected and Las-infected D. citri at various temperatures (20–37 °C). Cold-acclimated (6 ± 1 °C) D. citri adults were less susceptible to neonicotinoid insecticides as compared with non-acclimated controls, but this trend was not observed for other insecticides tested. A positive correlation between temperature and percentage mortality caused by chlorpyriphos, imidacloprid, spinetoram, and thiamethoxam was found irrespective of infection status when evaluated at temperatures ranging between 20 and 37 °C. In contrast, a negative correlation between temperature and percentage mortality was observed for fenpropathrin for both infected and uninfected psyllids. Glutathione S-transferase levels were negatively correlated with temperature, whereas levels of cytochrome P450 and general esterase were not correlated with temperature fluctuations. These results indicate that altered insecticide susceptibility due to temperature may not be related to glutathione S-transferase, cytochrome P450, and general esterase levels. Diaphorina citri adults that carried the Las bacterium had reduced CYP4 transcript and protein levels, and ingested less than uninfected counterparts, as measured by the production of honeydew. Diaphorina citri adult feeding was greatest at 32 °C within the temperature range tested. Overall, annual temperature fluctuation does not appear to be a major factor impacting management of D. citri.},

The biology of D. citri has been studied by Catling (1970); Pande (1971); Capoor et al. (1974); Yang (1989); Liu \& Tsai (2000); Nakata (2006); and Nava et al. (2007). In these studies, the host range of D. citri is reported to comprise numerous species within the Rutaceae, including citrus and close citrus relatives. While there are many field observations regarding host-plant associations of D. citri (Halbert \& Manjunath 2004), there are only 2 laboratory studies (Tsai \& Liu 2000; Nava et al. 2007) in which factors including fecundity, adult longevity, sex ratio, and survival and development period of immature stages have been compared on different host plants. In both studies, significant differences were reported for adult fecundity and survival of nymphs when D. citri was reared on different host plants. However, despite these differences, all citrus species evaluated were considered to be suitable host plants for D. citri.}

The average nymphal developmental periods on these four host plants were essentially the same except the Þfth stadium. Survival of immatures on orange jessamine, grapefruit, rough lemon, and sour orange was 75.4, 84.6, 78.3, and 68.6\%, respectively.

  abstract = {Abstract. Behavioural assays to study insect attraction to specific odours are tedious, time consuming and often require large numbers of replications. Olfactometer and flight tunnel tests can usually only be conducted with one or two odour sources at a time. Moreover, chemical information on the odour sources has to be obtained in separate analytical studies. An olfactometer was developed in which six odours can be tested simultaneously for their relative attractiveness while during the assays, part of each test odour can be trapped for further analyses. The effectiveness of this six-arm olfactometer was tested by observing the responses of the solitary endoparasitoid Cotesia marginiventris (Cresson) to host-induced odours from young maize plants. For statistical analyses, we used log-linear models were adapted to account for overdispersion and possible positional biases. Female wasps responded extremely well in tests where they were offered a single odour source, as well as in tests with multiple choices. The responses of wasps released in groups were the same as those released individually and it was found that females did not attract or repel each other, but males preferred arms in which females had been released. Dose–response tests with varying numbers of plants or host larvae on plants revealed that the wasps responded in a dose-related manner, thus showing that the system is well suited to measure relative preference. The clear choices of the insects amongst six possibilities provided substantial statistical power. Gas chromatographic analyses of sampled air revealed clean and effective odour trapping, which largely facilitates the comparison of results from behavioural assays with the actual blends of volatiles that were emitted by the various odour sources. Advantages and disadvantages compared to other methods are discussed.},

  abstract = {Hydroperoxide lyases (HPLs) catalyze the cleavage of fatty acid hydroperoxides to aldehydes and oxoacids. These volatile aldehydes play a major role in forming the aroma of many plant fruits and flowers. In addition, they have antimicrobial activity in vitro and thus are thought to be involved in the plant defense response against pest and pathogen attack. An HPL activity present in potato leaves has been characterized and shown to cleave specifically 13-hydroperoxides of both linoleic and linolenic acids to yield hexanal and 3-hexenal, respectively, and 12-oxo-dodecenoic acid. A cDNA encoding this HPL has been isolated and used to monitor gene expression in healthy and mechanically damaged potato plants. HPL gene expression is subject to developmental control, being high in young leaves and attenuated in older ones, and it is induced weakly by wounding. HPL enzymatic activity, nevertheless, remains constant in leaves of different ages and also after wounding, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms may regulate its activity levels. Antisense-mediated HPL depletion in transgenic potato plants has identified this enzyme as a major route of 13-fatty acid hydroperoxide degradation in the leaves. Although these transgenic plants have highly reduced levels of both hexanal and 3-hexenal, they show no phenotypic differences compared with wild-type ones, particularly in regard to the expression of wound-induced genes. However, aphids feeding on the HPL-depleted plants display approximately a two-fold increase in fecundity above those feeding on nontransformed plants, consistent with the hypothesis that HPL-derived products have a negative impact on aphid performance. Thus, HPL-catalyzed production of C6 aldehydes may be a key step of a built-in resistance mechanism of plants against some sucking insect pests.},

The frequency of application of a combination of pesticides has increased because of an increase in the occurrence of economically important pests of citrus. However, the combined effect of acaricide and other insecticides targeting B. yothersi is unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a combination of spirodiclofen and other insecticides on the control of B. yothersi. RESULTS Analysis using spirodiclofen alone resulted in 97.22\% efficiency in the control of B. yothersi on day 7 after application. A combination of spirodiclofen with either phosmet or imidacloprid resulted in 55\% and 59\% efficiency, respectively. A reduction in the efficiency of mite control by up to 42\% was observed when the mites were exposed to a combination of acaricide with other insecticides. CONCLUSIONS Application of a combination of spirodiclofen with phosmet or imidacloprid compromises the efficiency of acaricide in the control of B. yothersi.},

It was previously discovered that exposure to non-acaricidal insecticides alone or in a mixture, results in lower efficiency of the acaricide spirodiclofen used for Brevipalpus spp. control. We investigate here whether the induced expression of detoxification enzymes by non-lethal insecticides may antagonize spirodiclofen toxicity. Brevipalpus californicus mites exposed to the insecticide phosmet alone or in combination with spirodiclofen showed increased activity of P450 monooxygenases (P450s). No antagonistic effects in mite mortality were observed by the combination of phosmet and spirodiclofen. On the other hand, mites exposed to the insecticide imidacloprid alone or in combination with spirodiclofen showed an increase in the activity of P450s, carboxylcholinesterases (CCE), and glutathione-S-transferases (GST). An antagonistic effect on mite mortality was observed when mites were exposed to the LC25 of spirodiclofen combined with the field rate treatment of imidacloprid. The addition of PBO (a P450 monooxygenase inhibitor) to the mixture of spirodiclofen and imidacloprid resulted in a synergistic effect over mite mortality but the addition of DEM (a GST inhibitor) resulted in an antagonist effect. Taken together, this study showed that the combination of imidacloprid with spirodiclofen is antagonistic for the control of B. californicus, and this results from the induction of detoxification enzymes, such as P450s, CCE, and GST. The use of inhibitors highlights the role of these enzymes in the antagonism of the mixture.}

One larval type was completely yellow and was identified as Feltiella n. sp., while the second larval type had an orange color with a transverse white band close to the mouthparts. The latter cecidomyiid was identified as belonging to a genus near Lestodiplosis in the broad sense. Feltiella n. sp.

There were no significant differences (P {$>$} 0.05) in the consumption rates of either predator on any rust mite life stage.

The role of calcium in the detection of abiotic stress is well documented; however, its role during biotic interactions remains unclear. Here, we use a fluorescent calcium biosensor (GCaMP3) in combination with the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) as a tool to study Arabidopsis thaliana calcium dynamics in vivo and in real time during a live biotic interaction. We demonstrate rapid and highly localized plant calcium elevations around the feeding sites of M. persicae, and by monitoring aphid feeding behavior electrophysiologically, we demonstrate that these elevations correlate with aphid probing of epidermal and mesophyll cells. Furthermore, we dissect the molecular mechanisms involved, showing that interplay between the plant defense coreceptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 (BAK1), the plasma membrane ion channels GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE 3.3 and 3.6 (GLR3.3 and GLR3.6), and the vacuolar ion channel TWO-PORE CHANNEL1 (TPC1) mediate these calcium elevations. Consequently, we identify a link between plant perception of biotic threats by BAK1, cellular calcium entry mediated by GLRs, and intracellular calcium release by TPC1 during a biologically relevant interaction.},

This review surveys how SA in plants regulates both local disease resistance mechanisms, including host cell death and defense gene expression, and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). Genetic studies reveal an increasingly complex network of proteins required for SA-mediated defense signaling, and this process is amplified by several regulatory feedback loops. The interaction between the SA signaling pathway and those regulated by other plant hormones and/or defense signals is also discussed.},

Consequently, coloured pan trapping is an efficient technique that can be easily and cost-effectively used to quantitatively sample assemblages of anthophiles. However, colour preferences of anthophiles is an important source of bias that needs to be considered in pan trap surveys. By drawing sub samples comprised of different colour combinations from a database of pan trap surveys in the lowlands of the Cape Floristic Region, we examine the effects of colour on pan trap catches and determine which combinations of colours might provide better estimates of diversity when sampling with multi-colour sets of pan traps. Pan trap catches included the major groups of anthophiles in the region (Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera), but butterflies (Lepidoptera) were strongly under-represented. Colour played an important role in determining the species richness and composition of pan trap catches, with colour sets that included high reflectance yellow and white generally having catches with the highest species richness. While all colour combinations provided reasonable estimates of proportional species richness, proportional abundance of taxa varied among different colour sets, and did not accurately reflect actual proportions of different taxa in the entire dataset. For comparative biodiversity surveys and assessments we recommend the use of high reflectance colours such as white and yellow traps, while for full inventory surveys, it may be necessary to include other colours to catch rarer species that are excluded by the high reflectance colours alone.},

The vector and the bacteria have host plants outside the genus Citrus, and these plants have the potential to affect disease epidemiology within citrus groves. Murraya paniculata could be especially problematic because it is a popular ornamental plant and a host of both psyllid and bacteria. We conducted a year-long survey of eight urban plantings of M. paniculata in east-central Florida to characterize ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ infection rates in plants and associated psyllids. Using sensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) primers targeting two prophage genes of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’, we found infection to be extremely low: less than 1\% of psyllids and 1.8\% of plants. With qPCR primers targeting ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ 16S rDNA, none of the plants and only one psyllid were ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’-positive. Therefore, the titer of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ is low in M. paniculata and associated psyllids. These results suggest that urban plantings of M. paniculata may serve as a minor source of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ inoculum.},

  abstract = {More than 40,000 species of mites have been described, and up to 1 million may exist on earth. These tiny arachnids play many ecological roles including acting as vectors of disease, vital players in soil formation, and important agents of biological control. But despite the grand diversity of mites, even trained biologists are often unaware of their significance. Mites: Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour (2\textbackslash textsuperscriptnd edition) aims to fill the gaps in our understanding of these intriguing creatures. It surveys life cycles, feeding behaviour, reproductive biology and host-associations of mites without requiring prior knowledge of their morphology or taxonomy. Topics covered include evolution of mites and other arachnids, mites in soil and water, mites on plants and animals, sperm transfer and reproduction, mites and human disease, and mites as models for ecological and evolutionary theories.},

The effects of jasmonic acid (JA) at 1.5 and 2.5 mM, and acibenzolar-S-methyl (benzothiadiazole, BTH) at 0.5 and 1.5 mM, applied separately or together, on the fecundity of T. urticae females in a laboratory test as well as on the population growth of the pest in a greenhouse experiment were determined. The influence of both elicitors on the induction of LOX and PAL gene expression was assessed in a parallel experiment using real-time PCR. Jasmonic acid showed significantly higher effectiveness in inducing apple tree resistance to T. urticae, as compared to BTH. This was particularly evident in the reduction in pest numbers that was observed in the greenhouse experiment and was also confirmed by increased LOX gene expression after treatment with JA. BTH induced the expression of the PAL gene more strongly than jasmonic acid; however, this was not reflected in the performance of the two-spotted spider mite in the laboratory and greenhouse experiments. It was also found that the antagonistic effect of BTH on JA might lead to decreased effectiveness of the jasmonic acid used to induce apple tree resistance to the two-spotted spider mite. Although nitrogen fertilization stimulated the development of spider mite populations, the resistance induction mechanism was more effective in N-fertilized plants, which was especially evident at the higher jasmonic acid concentration.},

A well-studied example of this “immunity” reaction is systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in tobacco. SAR is characterized by the development of a diseaseresistant state in plants that have reacted hypersensitively to previous infection by tobacco mosaic virus. Here, we show that the onset of SAR correlates with the coordinate induction of nine classes of mRNAs. Salicylic acid, a candidate for the endogenous signal that activates the resistant state, induces expression of the same “SAR genes.” A novel synthetic immunization compound, methyl-2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid, also induces both resistance and SAR gene expression. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that induced resistance results at least partially from coordinate expression of these SAR genes. A model is presented that ties pathogeninduced necrosis to the biosynthesis of salicylic acid and the induction of SAR.},

We show that negative population-density and -size dependency limited the reproduction of foundresses, where the effects of population size on population growth overweighed that of population density. We further demonstrate that ovipositing females could accelerate population growth rate (intrinsic rate of increase, rm) at higher population sizes by producing more daughters early during their lifespan, which can be an adaptive strategy to allow more daughters to complete development and disperse to reduce future food competition intensity. This study provided knowledge on population dynamics in response to foundress population density and size in general and T. ludeni population forecast and precise timing of pest management in particular.},

  abstract = {Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB) is regarded as the most severe disease threading the citrus industry. The basic aim of this study was to assess the changes of structure and functionality of the photosynthetic machinery induced by HLB and establish a discriminant model for rapid HLB detection using structural and functional features of photosynthesis system. Polyphasic chlorophyll a fluorescence transient was measured from healthy, asymptomatic and symptomatic HLB-infected leaves of two different cultivars namely (Navel orange and Satsuma). According to the polyphasic chlorophyll a fluorescence transient, HLB induced a positive L-band, K-band and J-band; a significant reduction in Fv/Fo, ΦEo, ψEo, ΦRo, ΦPo, PIabs, PItotal, Fm, REo/RC and ETo/RC, and a significant increase in TRo/RC, Fo, ABS/RC and DIo/RC. The results suggested that the main disturbances of photosynthetic structure and function in HLB-infected leaves were associated with impairment of energetic connectivity of antennae in photosystem II (PSII), dysfunction of oxygen-evolving complex and inhibition of QA− reoxidation. This phenomenon was similar in two different cultivars. Despite the fact that HLB infected symptomatic and magnesium deficient leaves can be often mistaken for each other by human eyes in the field condition, our results showed that some photosynthetic parameters could be considered as a potential proxy for distinguishing them from each other according to the results from principal component analysis (PCA). Moreover, the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) established based on the selected JIP-test parameters achieved overall detection accuracies of 95.0\% for Navel orange and 96\% for Satsuma using model transfer strategy. These results of OJIP records provided valuable information about the structure and function of photosynthetic apparatus in HLB infected leaves, and the photosynthetic fingerprints can be used for high-throughput HLB detection combining with advanced machine learning.},

Despite the great economic importance of D. citri to citrus production, little is known about the reproductive biology and behavior of this insect. We conducted studies to determine the copula duration, the age at which both males and females reach reproductive maturity, the pre-oviposition period, the daily timing of mating activity in a laboratory colony, and the temporal dynamics in the sex ratio of a cohort of newly eclosed adults. The emergence patterns of males and females were strikingly similar, with no evidence for protandry or protogyny. Both sexes reached reproductive maturity by 2-3 d post-eclosion. Oviposition generally began within 1 d after mating, but was longer when females were mated at 2 d of age. Mean ± SEM copula duration was 48.3 ± 8.4 minutes (range: 15.2-98.0). Mating on orange jasmine was observed almost exclusively on flush shoots during daylight hours, with no obvious peak of daily mating activity. Mating activity may be constrained during scotophase in part by cooler temperatures and lack of light. Methods for carrying out mating experiments with this species are described.},

For the short-duration treatments, females lay more eggs per day when grouped with multiple males, whereas females in the long-duration treatments lay more eggs when paired with one male. When held for 24 h with one or three males, females show a decline in fecundity beginning 10 and 15 days after mating, respectively. Total fecundity is relatively high for females paired with one male for 2 weeks, but fecundity is low and mortality high when females are held with three males for 2 weeks. In treatments in which females are held with males for 2 weeks, oviposition increases dramatically in the days after removal of males. For females paired with a male for 24 h and re-paired for 24 h, 9 days later, fecundity remains high throughout the 18–19-day observation period. Egg fertility does not differ among treatments, but varies over time in a manner that is similar among treatments. The present study demonstrates that, in D. citri, females require multiple matings over time to achieve high reproductive output, but oviposition is constrained by the presence of males.},

  abstract = {Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) is an important worldwide pest of citrus that vectors bacteria (Candidatus Liberibacter spp.) responsible for huanglongbing (citrus greening disease). We examined the behavioral responses of mated and unmated D. citri of both sexes to odors from host plants in a Y-tube olfactometer, with and without visual cues. The host plants tested were ÔDuncanÕ grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macfayden), sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.), navel orange (C. sinensis L.), and Murraya paniculata L. Jack. Responses varied by plant species, psyllid sex and mating status, and the presence of a visual cue. Evidence of attraction generally was stronger in females and in mated individuals of both sexes relative to virgins. The presence of a visual cue typically enhanced attractiveness of olfactory cues; in no case did unmated individuals show evidence of attraction to host plant odors in the absence of a visual cue. In the absence of visual cues, mated females and males showed evidence of attraction only to odors from sour orange and navel orange, respectively. Psyllids exhibited anemotactic responses when assayed with plant odors alone but showed strong evidence of attraction only when olfactory and visual cues were combined, suggesting that olfactory cues facilitate orientation to host plants but may be insufÞcient alone. Antennal responses to citrus volatiles were conÞrmed by electroantennogram. The results reported here provide evidence that D. citri uses olfactory and visual cues in orientation to host plants and suggest the possibility of using plant volatiles in monitoring and management of this pest.},

  abstract = {Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), a vector of huanglongbing (citrus greening disease), exhibits three more or less distinct abdominal colors in the adult stage: gray/brown, blue/green, and orange/yellow. A previous report showed that, relative to blue/green individuals, gray/brown individuals of both sexes have lower body mass, and gray/brown females may have lower reproductive output. In the present investigation, we directly examined the relationships between female and male abdominal color and reproductive output. We also assessed how psyllid body mass was inßuenced by transfer to fresh plant material and how female and male abdominal color affected behavioral responses of males to crushed females in a petri dish assay. Relative to blue/green females, gray/brown females exhibited lower fecundity over the Þrst 2Ð5 d after mating, but fecundity did not differ over the remainder of a 21-d observation period. Regardless of abdominal color, females mated with gray/brown males showed an earlier, sharper peak in fecundity, whereas females mated with blue/green males showed a later, more gradual peak in fecundity. Gray/brown males elicited lower egg fertility in their mates, but egg fertility did not vary according to female abdominal color. MalesÑirrespective of abdominal colorÑ exhibited stronger evidence of attraction to crushed blue/ green females than to crushed gray/brown females. Gray/brown individuals of both sexes showed an increase in body mass 5Ð 6 d after transfer to a new citrus seedling, suggesting that abdominal color (which is closely related to body mass) may be inßuenced at least in part by plant quality.},

Recently, data from conventional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been used to facilitate the descriptions and complement the information that has been historically obtained with the light microscope. However, the conventional preparation techniques associated with SEM frequently prevent or compromise the results. This study evaluated the use of low-temperature field emission SEM to image mites and their hosts. Results indicated that a modified cryofixation procedure, which was associated with this technique, retained the mites at their living/feeding sites in natural behavioral positions. Furthermore, the turgor of the specimens, even eggs and soft-bodied species, was also maintained. The structure and orientation of delicate structures such as setae, which would be subjected to mechanical damage during conventional chemical fixation, dehydration, and drying, were also preserved after cryofixation. Field emission SEM, which provided useful magnification beyond that attainable with a conventional SEM, also enabled resolution of ultrastructural features, such as tenent hairs on the empodium and pores on the dorsal surface that had not previously been observed. These advantages indicate that the low-temperature field emission SEM can provide important structural data that can be used to study the anatomy, morphology, and bioecology of mites.},

  abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) is a serious and devastating disease of citrus caused by Candidatus Liberibacter spp. and vectored by the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Psyllidae). The disease has the potential to greatly limit the production of citrus in Florida and other citrus-growing regions worldwide. Current control of D. citri and HLB is inadequate, but the identification and incorporation of D. citri resistance traits from uncultivated Citrus spp. and Citrus relatives is seen as a potential disease management strategy. In this study, seedlings of 87 Rutaceae seed-source genotypes, primarily in the orange subfamily Aurantioideae, were assessed in the field for their propensity in a free-choice situation for infestations of natural south Florida populations of D. citri. The majority of test populations surveyed hosted all three life stages of D. citri; however, there were significant differences among the test populations in the mean ranks for D. citri eggs (F = 3.13, df = 86, P ¡ 0.0001), nymphs (F = 9.01, df = 86, P ¡ 0.0001), and adults (F = 4.21, df = 86, P ¡ 0.0001). The only sampled test population that was completely avoided by all life stages of D. citri was seedlings of Casimiroa edulis Llave et Lex, commonly known as white sapote, which was one of the few plants included in the study belonging to the Rutaceae subfamily Toddalioideae. Although not completely avoided, very low levels of D. citri were found on two surveyed test populations of Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf, seedlings of ‘Simmon's trifoliate’ and ‘Little-Leaf’. Poncirus trifoliata, the trifoliate orange, readily forms hybrids with Citrus spp., is commonly incorporated into rootstock varieties, and has been used in breeding-advanced scion material. The identification of partial resistance in P. trifoliata to D. citri could prove useful in future citrus breeding efforts aimed at reducing the incidence and spread of HLB. Determining if there is true resistance to D. citri in this and other germplasm sources with a low propensity for infestations in free-choice situations will require no-choice experiments.}

  abstract = {Invasive species are believed to spread through a process of stratified dispersal consisting of short-distance diffusive spread around established foci and human mediated long-distance jumps. Brazilian peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolius), native to South America, was introduced twice as an ornamental plant into Florida, USA, just over 100 years ago. A previous study indicated that these two introductions were from genetically differentiated source populations in the native range. In this study, we took advantage of these contrasting genetic signatures to study the spatial spread of Brazilian peppertree across its entire range in Florida. A combination of spatial genetic and geostatistical analyses using chloroplast and nuclear microsatellite markers revealed evidence for both diffusive dispersal and long-distance jumps. Chloroplast DNA haplotype distributions and extensive bands of intra-specific hybridization revealed extensive dispersal by both introduced populations across the state. The strong genetic signature around the original introduction points, the presence of a general southeast to northwest genetic cline, and evidence for short-distance genetic spatial autocorrelation provided evidence of diffusive dispersal from an advancing front, probably by birds and small mammals. In the northernmost part of the range, there were patches having a high degree of ancestry from each introduction, suggesting long-distance jump dispersal, probably by the movement of humans. The evidence for extensive movement throughout the state suggests that Brazilian peppertree will be capable of rapidly recolonizing areas from which it has been eradicated. Concerted eradication efforts over large areas or the successful establishment of effective biocontrol agents over a wide area will be needed to suppress this species.},

In this study, the infection and titers of CLas in the psyllid, were monitored for life cycle stage, sex, host-plant CLas titer, host-plant genotype, and ambient temperature. RESULTS: Acquisition efficiency of CLas by D. citri was highest in nymphs reared at 25 ∘C on a host plant with high CLas titers but was independent of the host genotypes assessed and of vector sex. We further observed that D. citri nymphs acquired CLas more rapidly than adults based on acquisition access periods (AAPs). CLas did not multiply in the alimentary canal, hemolymph, and salivary glands of adults for 18 days after a 3-day AAP as adult. However, CLas multiplication was detected in hemolymph and salivary gland of adults after the bacterium was acquired by nymphs. Eighty percent of salivary glands of adults contained CLas 18 days after a 3-day AAP as nymph compared to 10\% 18 days after a 3-day AAP as adults. CONCLUSION: Different factors tested herein influenced CLas acquisition efficiency of D. citri, CLas multiplication and spread inside the psyllid. These observations serve to better understand mechanisms of CLas infection in D. citri. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

The present study established ornamental peppers as banker plants supporting Amblyseius swirskii (Acari: Phytoseiidae) against the three pests. Specifically, this study (a) evaluated survival and population buildup of A. swirskii on three ornamental pepper varieties, Masquerade (MA), Red Missile (RM), and Explosive Ember (EE) in both laboratory and greenhouses and (b) determined the predation of A. swirskii reared on ornamental pepper plants to the targeted pests under greenhouse conditions. The results showed that the three pepper varieties were excellent banker plants and able to support at least \$\textbackslash sim\$1000 of all stages of A. swirskii per plant in greenhouse conditions and allow them to complete their life cycle. A. swirskii dispersed or released from the banker plants to target plants, resulting in significant suppression of the three pests, i.e., after 14 d post-release, a significantly lower average of 2.75 B. tabaci and 13.4 all stages of thrips (chilli thrips and western flower thrips) were found per bean plant, respectively, compared to 379.5 B. tabaci and 235.4 all stages of thrips per plant in the control. Furthermore, our experiment observed that the sweet pepper seedlings closed to banker plants were healthy, whereas those without banker plants were heavily infested by chilli thrips; their growth seriously stunted or died. This is the first report of ornamental pepper as banker plants supporting A. swirskii against three notorious pests. This established banker plant system could be a new addition to the integrated pest management programs for sustainable control of these three pests in greenhouse vegetables.}

Compared with control plants, total peroxidases and glucanases increased twofold and eightfold, respectively, in all protected bean tissues. BNR 232-CG could not be recovered from the challenged hypocotyls or cotyledons, indicating that there was no contact between the inducer and the pathogen. Both the 1,3-beta-glucanases and the peroxidases were positively correlated with induced resistance.}

First described from what is now Pakistan, the parasitoid has been introduced deliberately or inadvertently throughout Asia and the Americas wherever the psyllid now occurs. Interest in T. radiata for biological control of D. citri has grown in response to continued spread of ACP and HLB, and the evident searching and colonization capabilities of the parasitoid. Mass release is seen as a potential strategy to augment area wide management of D. citri, particularly where pesticides are not extensively used. Efficient mass rearing and eventual success of these programs will require the best possible information on biology of T. radiata including life history parameters, host relationships, sensory perception, environmental responses and genetics. Much early literature on T. radiata is in Chinese and therefore inaccessible to those not able to read the language. The present review covers the literature through 2014. The intent is to summarize what is known about biology of T. radiata to aid research efforts, with the objective of contributing to more effective biological control of this pest.},

Currently, no remedial therapy exists for the disease, and so effective control of ACP is very important in curbing the transmission of the disease. The push–pull strategy should be thoroughly explored as an approach to ACP management. This mini-review summarises the current progress towards more effective repellent and attractant chemicals through investigating known repellent and attractive plants. Interactions between ACP and its host plants are also addressed, with emphasis on the possible involvement of the host biochemicals in attracting the insect. Potential ways to increase the effectiveness of the pull–push strategy are briefly discussed. It is expected that the pull–push strategy will be gradually developed following more extensive research.},

A comprehensive understanding of molecular components that govern key physiological traits in D. citri would promote the development of novel genetic control strategies to fight this pest. In the present study, a transformer 2 homologue (Dctra-2) implicated in embryonic sex differentiation in dipteran insects is targeted to interfere with the offspring sex ratio of D. citri. The results of the present study show that Dctra-2 is constitutively expressed at all developmental stages and in both females and males during the adult stage. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirms the double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) of the Dctra-2. RNAi effects in D. citri female adults can be transferred in a trans-generational manner to their eggs and progeny, which are commonly referred as parental RNAi. RNAi females lay fewer eggs, with a mean of 12.44, and the hatching rate of laid eggs is reduced approximately by 29.86\% compared with the control. However, parental RNAi of Dctra-2 do not produce male-biased progeny. The results suggest that Dctra-2 is an effective RNAi target for use in the management of D. citri. In addition, the parental RNAi would provide an effective tool for studying the function of early embryonic genes in D. citri.},

Sentinel defense gene RNAs were monitored in SLWF-infested and control plants. Salicylic acid (SA)-responsive gene transcripts accumulated locally (PR1, BGL2, PR5, SID2, EDS5, PAD4) and systemically (PR1, BGL2, PR5) during SLWF nymph feeding. In contrast, jasmonic acid (JA)- and ethylene-dependent RNAs (PDF1.2, VSP1, HEL, THI2.1, FAD3, ERS1, ERF1) were repressed or not modulated in SLWF-infested leaves. To test for a role of SA and JA pathways in basal defense, SLWF development on mutant and transgenic lines that constitutively activate or impair defense pathways was determined. By monitoring the percentage of SLWF nymphs in each instar, we show that mutants that activate SA defenses (cim10) or impair JA defenses (coi1) accelerated SLWF nymphal development. Reciprocally, mutants that activate JA defenses (cev1) or impair SA defenses (npr1, NahG) slowed SLWF nymphal development. Furthermore, when npr1 plants, which do not activate downstream SA defenses, were treated with methyl jasmonate, a dramatic delay in nymph development was observed. Collectively, these results showed that SLWF-repressed, JA-regulated defenses were associated with basal defense to the SLWF.},

  abstract = {Plants under herbivore attack are able to initiate indirect defense by synthesizing and releasing complex blends of volatiles that attract natural enemies of the herbivore. However, little is known about how plants respond to infestation by multiple herbivores, particularly if these belong to different feeding guilds. Here, we report the interference by a phloem-feeding insect, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, with indirect plant defenses induced by spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) in Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) plants. Additional whitefly infestation of spider-mite infested plants resulted in a reduced attraction of predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis) compared to attraction to plants infested by spider mites only. This interference is shown to result from the reduction in (E)-β-ocimene emission from plants infested by both spider mites and whiteflies. When using exogenous salicylic acid (SA) application to mimic B. tabaci infestation, we observed similar results in behavioral and chemical analyses. Phytohormone and gene-expression analyses revealed that B. tabaci infestation, as well as SA application, inhibited spider mite-induced jasmonic acid (JA) production and reduced the expression of two JA-regulated genes, one of which encodes for the P. lunatus enzyme β-ocimene synthase that catalyzes the synthesis of (E)-β-ocimene. Remarkably, B. tabaci infestation concurrently inhibited SA production induced by spider mites. We therefore conclude that in dual-infested Lima bean plants the suppression of the JA signaling pathway by whitefly feeding is not due to enhanced SA levels.},

Many citrus orchards in China have been destroyed by HLB infection. The survival time of ACPs without food was related to the temperature they experienced. The longest survival time of adult ACPs was 5.93 ± 0.12 days when the mean temperature was approximately 12 °C. The shortest lifespan of ACP adults was 2.33 ± 0.12 days when the mean temperature on the test day was approximately 26 °C. Surprisingly, ACP could feed on herbaceous plants in the absence of preferred hosts. The most suitable weed species for the ACP was Solanum nigrum, with the longest survival time of 41 days for all individuals tested. The survival time of ACPs feeding on herbaceous plants was also related to temperature. The surviving 20\% and 10\% of ACP adults in the Solanum nigrum treatment showed no decline but slight improvement as compared with control in the fecundity. In conclusion, some ACPs may be able to live for a month or even longer in an orchard if suitable plants and temperatures are available. The Las-infected ACPs that can survive by feeding on herbaceous plants may be sources of Las infection in replanted orchards. The suggested time to replant citrus in groves that were previously infected with Las is summer to autumn, or it is recommended to leave the land idle for more than three months. Graphical abstract This study discussed the survival time of Asian Citrus Psyllids in a range of temperatures without food. It was found that the survival time of psyllids decreased sharply as the temperature increased. Interestingly, this work also suggested that psyllids could feed on herbaceous plants rather than their typical food source to survive temporarily.}

After starvation for 48 h, the predatory efficiency of A. hainanensis was significantly higher than those that had been starved for 24 or 72 h when 30–50 B. obovatus eggs were made available. The predation of A. hainanensis on B. obovatus also increased with increasing prey density. The number of prey attacked by A. hainanensis in a 3.2 cm2 habitat was significantly higher than in a 6.3 cm2 habitat. The average predation of A. hainanensis was 31.7 eggs per day when offered 100 B. obovatus eggs on a tea leaf. This decreased to 17.8 eggs per day when four A. hainanensis shared 100 B. obovatus eggs. B. obovatus populations can be reduced by artificial rainfall, with the reduction affected by rainfall intensity. With an intensity of 40 mm in 15 min, 90.2 \% mortality of B. obovatus occurred; lower mortalities were recorded (13.3 and 29.8 \%) when the intensity was 2 or 4 mm in 15 min. Combination of the predatory mite A. hainanensis and artificial rainfall for the integrated pest management of B. obovatus is discussed.},
